\section{Certification Schemes for Linear Programs} \label{sec:certification}

  In this section, we present examples of certification schemes for frequently arising problems such as computing the sum 
of values or functions that can be expressed as a linear programs. In the next section we will see the more general statement
about certification schemes for functions that satisfy a general Lipschitz continuity condition.

\subsection{Computing the Sum of Records} \label{ssec:certificationSum}

  One of the most basic certification tasks is computing the sum of the values of the records. For this task, we are given $n$ 
positive real numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ each one comming from a record in our data set. Our goal is to certify whether the
sum of all the records is closed to the sum of the subset of records that are valid, i.e. belong to $\Truth$. 

  More formally, we want to check with probability of failure at most $\delta > 0$ whether 
$\sum_{i \in \Workers} x_i \in \left[1 - \eps, \frac{1}{1 - \eps} \right] \cdot \sum_{i \in \Truth} x_i$ or there is at least 
one record $i$ such that $i \notin {\cal T}$. We show that there exists an efficient certification scheme for this task:

  \caption{If the invalid records make up more than $\eps$ fraction of the total sum, there is at least $\eps$ probability that an invalid record is found with a single verification.}
\end{figure}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:sumV}
Let $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \ge 0$ be the values of the records in $\Workers$ and $f(\xw) = \sum_{i \in \Workers} x_i$. Consider 
the probability distribution $p_i = \frac {x_i} {\sum_j x_j}$ which assigns to each record a probability proportional to its 
value $x_i$. Verifying $k=\Theta(\frac{1}{\eps}\log (1/\delta))$ records sampled independently from $p$, guarantees that the 
certification task succeeds with probability at least $1 - \delta$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Since $\Truth\subseteq \Workers$ and $x_i$'s are positive numbers, the inequality 
$\sum_{i \in \Workers} x_i \ge (1-\eps) \sum_{i \in \Truth} x_i$ holds trivially. If the inequality 
$\sum_{i \in \Workers} x_i \le \frac 1 {1-\eps} \sum_{i \in \Truth} x_i$ does not hold, we can bound the probability that all 
of the $k$ verifications fail to find an invalid record, as follows:

The probability that a single verification fails to find an invalid record is 
$\sum_{i \in \Truth} p_i = \frac {\sum_{i \in \Truth} x_i} {\sum_{i \in \Workers} x_i} < 1 - \eps.$

Therefore the probability that all $k$ verifications fail is at most $(1-\eps)^k$. Setting 
$k = \Theta(\frac{1}{\eps}\log (1/\delta))$, we guarantee that an invalid record is found with probability at least $1-\delta$.
\end{proof}
