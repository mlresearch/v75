abstract = {
We consider the problem of minimizing a convex function over a convex
set given access only to an evaluation oracle for the function and
a membership oracle for the set. We give a simple algorithm which
solves this problem with $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ oracle calls and $\tilde{O}(n^{3})$
additional arithmetic operations. Using this result, we obtain more
efficient reductions among the five basic oracles for convex sets
and functions defined by Gr{\"o}tschel, Lov{\'a}sz, and Schrijver (1988).
