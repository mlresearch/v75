abstract = {We study the sample complexity of learning neural networks, by 
providing new bounds on their Rademacher complexity assuming norm constraints 
on the parameter matrix of each layer. Compared to previous work, these 
complexity bounds have improved dependence on the network depth, and under some 
additional assumptions, are fully independent of the network size (both depth 
and width). These results are derived using some novel techniques, which may be 
of independent interest.}
