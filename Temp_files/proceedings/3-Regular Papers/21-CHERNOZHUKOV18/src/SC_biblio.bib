	Starting with simple forecasts based on fixed and random effects
	panel data models. Next, these forecasts are extended to allow for
	various \{ARMA\} type structure on the disturbances, as well as spatial
	autoregressive and moving average type disturbances. These forecasting
	methods are then studied in the context of seemingly unrelated regressions.
	We highlight several forecasting empirical applications using panel
	data, as well as several Monte Carlo studies that compare various
	forecasting methods using panel data. The chapter concludes with
	suggestions for further work in this area. },

abstract ={Background BRCA1-mutant breast tumors are typically estrogen receptor alpha (ER?) negative, whereas most sporadic tumors express wild-type BRCA1 and are ER? positive. We examined a possible mechanism for the observed ER?-negative phenotype of BRCA1-mutant tumors.Methods We used a breast cancer diseasespecific microarray to identify transcripts that were differentially expressed between paraffin-embedded samples of 17 BRCA1-mutant and 14 sporadic breast tumors. We measured the mRNA levels of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) (the gene encoding ER?), which was differentially expressed in the tumor samples, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Regulation of ESR1 mRNA and ER? protein expression was assessed in human breast cancer HCC1937 cells that were stably reconstituted with wild-type BRCA1 expression construct and in human breast cancer T47D and MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with BRCA1-specific short-interfering RNA (siRNA). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to determine if BRCA1 binds the ESR1 promoter and to identify other interacting proteins. Sensitivity to the antiestrogen drug fulvestrant was examined in T47D and MCF-7 cells transfected with BRCA1-specific siRNA. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results Mean ESR1 gene expression was 5.4-fold lower in BRCA1-mutant tumors than in sporadic tumors (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6-fold to 40.1-fold, P = .0019). The transcription factor Oct-1 recruited BRCA1 to the ESR1 promoter, and both BRCA1 and Oct-1 were required for ER? expression. BRCA1-depleted breast cancer cells expressing exogenous ER? were more sensitive to fulvestrant than BRCA1-depleted cells transfected with empty vector (T47D cells, the mean concentration of fulvestrant that inhibited the growth of 40\% of the cells [IC40] for empty vector versus ER?: >10?5 versus 8.0 ? 10?9 M [95\% CI = 3.1 ? 10?10 to 3.2 ? 10?6 M]; MCF-7 cells, mean IC40 for empty vector versus ER?: >10?5 versus 4.9 ? 10?8 M [95\% CI = 2.0 ? 10?9 to 3.9 ? 10?6 M]).Conclusions BRCA1 alters the response of breast cancer cells to antiestrogen therapy by directly modulating ER? expression.},

	abstract = {Disappearance of the Barr body is considered a hallmark of cancer, although whether this corresponds to genetic loss or to epigenetic instability and transcriptional reactivation is unclear. Here we show that breast tumors and cell lines frequently display major epigenetic instability of the inactive X chromosome, with highly abnormal 3D nuclear organization and global perturbations of heterochromatin, including gain of euchromatic marks and aberrant distributions of repressive marks such as H3K27me3 and promoter DNA methylation. Genome-wide profiling of chromatin and transcription reveal modified epigenomic landscapes in cancer cells, and a significant degree of aberrant gene activity from the inactive X chromosome, including several genes involved in cancer promotion. We demonstrate that many of these genes are aberrantly reactivated in primary breast tumors and we further demonstrate that epigenetic instability of the inactive X can lead to perturbed dosage of X-linked factors. Taken together, our study provides the first integrated analysis of the inactive X chromosome in the context of breast cancer and establishes that epigenetic erosion of the inactive X can lead to the disappearance of the Barr body in breast cancer cells. This work offers new insights and opens up the possibility of exploiting the inactive X chromosome as an epigenetic biomarker at the molecular and cytological levels in cancer.},

 abstract = {In a seminal paper Abadie et al (2010) develop the synthetic control procedure for estimating the effect of a treatment, in the presence of a single treated unit and a number of control units, with pre-treatment outcomes observed for all units. The method constructs a set of weights such that covariates and  pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units. The weights are  restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which allows the procedure to obtain the weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a setting that is not uncommon in applications.  In the current paper we propose a more general class of synthetic control estimators that allows researchers to relax some of the restrictions in the ADH method. We allow the weights to be negative, do not necessarily restrict the sum of the weights, and allow for a permanent additive difference between the treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-in-difference procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.},

abstract="The traditional perturbation (or lexicographic) methods for resolving degeneracy in linear programming impose decision rules that eliminate ties in the simplex ratio rule and, therefore, restrict the choice of exiting basic variables. Bland's combinatorial pivoting rule also restricts the choice of exiting variables. Using ideas from parametric linear programming, we develop anticycling pivoting rules that do not limit the choice of exiting variables beyond the simplex ratio rule. That is, any variable that ties for the ratio rule can leave the basis. A similar approach gives pivoting rules for the dual simplex method that do not restrict the choice of entering variables.",

	with a deterministic component. We show that when the data are strongly
	serially correlated, forecasts based on a model that detrends the
	data using OLS before estimating the autoregressive parameters are
	much less precise than those based on an autoregression that includes
	the deterministic components, and the asymptotic distribution of
	the forecast errors under the two-step procedure exhibits bimodality.
	We explore the conditions under which feasible GLS trend estimation
	can lead to forecast error reduction. The finite sample properties
	of OLS and feasible GLS forecasts are compared with forecasts based
	on unit root pretesting. The procedures are applied to 15 macroeconomic
	time series to obtain real time forecasts. Forecasts based on feasible
	GLS trend estimation tend to be more efficient than forecasts based
	on OLS trend estimation. A new finding is when a unit root pretest
	rejects non-stationarity, use of GLS yields smaller forecast errors
	than OLS. When the series to be forecasted is highly persistent,
	GLS trend estimation in conjunction with unit root pretests can lead
	to sharp reduction in forecast errors.},

	ICAPM that uses a daily summary measure of economic activity to track
	time-varying investment opportunities. We then use nonparametric
	projections to compute a robust estimate of the conditional covariance
	between stock market returns and our daily economic activity index.
	We find that the new conditional covariance risk measure plays an
	important role in explaining time variation in the equity risk premium.
	Specification tests as well as out-of-sample forecasts of aggregate
	stock returns suggest that the new covariance risk measure performs
	well compared to alternative covariance measures previously proposed
	in the literature.},

	The relevant environments are ones in which predictions depend on
	estimated parameters. We show that standard regression statistics
	generally fail to account for errors introduced by estimation of
	these parameters. We propose computationally convenient test statistics
	that properly account for such errors. Simulations indicate that
	the procedures can work well in samples of size typically available,

In addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire.},

We contrast treatment effect estimates obtained using Bai (2009) with those obtained using difference in differences and synthetic controls (Abadie and coauthors). We show that difference in differences are generically biased, and we derive support conditions for synthetic controls. We construct Monte Carlo experiments to compare these estimation methods in small samples. As an empirical illustration, we provide an evaluation of the impact on local unemployment of an enterprise zone policy implemented in France in the 1990s. }

To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after the rise. Comparisons of employment growth at stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage was constant) provide simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. We also compare employment changes at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (above $5) to the changes at lower-wage stores. We find no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.},

We fit a components-of-variance model to earnings of the comparison group and use a simple model of program participation to predict the earnings histories of the trainees. These predictions provide an estimate of the effect of training and an overidentification test of the model. Our program estimates are very sensitive to the model of participation (ranging from 200 to 2000), and we conclude that randomized clinical trials are necessary to reliably determine program effects.},

    abstract = { This paper considers causal inference and sample selection bias in nonexperimental settings in which (i) few units in the nonexperimental comparison group are comparable to the treatment units, and (ii) selecting a subset of comparison units similar to the treatment units is difficult because units must be compared across a high-dimensional set of pre-treatment characteristics. We discuss the use of propensity score-matching methods, and implement them using data from the National Supported Work experiment. Following LaLonde (1986), we pair the experimental treated units with nonexperimental comparison units from the CPS and PSID, and compare the estimates of the treatment effect obtained using our methods to the benchmark results from the experiment. For both comparison groups, we show that the methods succeed in focusing attention on the small subset of the comparison units comparable to the treated units and, hence, in alleviating the bias due to systematic differences between the treated and comparison units. }

 abstract = {We apply the Synthetic Control Method to re-examine the labor market effects of the Mariel Boatlift, first studied by David Card (1990). This method improves on previous studies by choosing a control group of cities that best matches Miami?s labor market trends pre-Boatlift and providing more reliable inference. Using a sample of non-Cuban high-school dropouts we find no significant difference in the wages of workers in Miami relative to its control after 1980. We also show that by focusing on small sub-samples and matching the control group on a short pre-1979 series, as done in Borjas (2017), one can find large wage differences between Miami and control because of large measurement error.},

 abstract = {In difference-in-differences applications, identification of the key parameter often arises from changes in policy by a small number of groups. In contrast, typical inference assumes that the number of groups changing policy is large. We present an alternative inference approach for a small (finite) number of policy changers, using information from a large sample of nonchanging groups. Treatment effect point estimators are not consistent, but we can consistently estimate their asymptotic distribution under any point null hypothesis about the treatment. Thus, treatment point estimators can be used as test statistics, and confidence intervals can be constructed using test statistic inversion.},

abstract="Conformal predictors are set predictors that are automatically valid in the sense of having coverage probability equal to or exceeding a given confidence level. Inductive conformal predictors are a computationally efficient version of conformal predictors satisfying the same property of validity. However, inductive conformal predictors have only been known to control unconditional coverage probability. This paper explores various versions of conditional validity and various ways to achieve them using inductive conformal predictors and their modifications. In particular, it discusses a convenient expression of one of the modifications in terms of ROC curves.",
