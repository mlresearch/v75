to assess their current use of information technology (IT). Our results
suggest that adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) is progressing
slowly, at least in smaller practices, although a number of group
practices plan to implement an EHR within the next two years. Moreover,
the process of choosing and implementing an EHR appears to be more
complex and varied than we expected. This suggests a need for greater
support for practices, particularly smaller ones, in this quest if
the benefits expected from EHRs are to be realized.},

Our hypothesis is that a patient-management decision that is unusual with respect to past patient care may be due to an error and that it is worthwhile to generate an alert if such a decision is encountered. We evaluate this hypothesis using data obtained from EHRs of 4486 post-cardiac surgical patients and a subset of 222 alerts generated from the data. We base the evaluation on the opinions of a panel of experts. The results of the study support our hypothesis that the outlier-based alerting can lead to promising true alert rates. We observed true alert rates that ranged from 25\% to 66\% for a variety of patient-management actions, with 66\% corresponding to the strongest outliers.},

attributes can be extremely difficult. Feature selection helps us
to decide what attributes or combination of attributes are most important
for finding these patterns. In this chapter, we study feature selection
methods for building classification models from high-throughput genomic
(microarray) and proteomic (mass spectrometry) data sets. Thousands
of feature candidates must be analyzed, compared and combined in
such data sets. We describe the basics of four different approaches
used for feature selection and illustrate their effects on an MS
cancer proteomic data set. The closing discussion provides assistance
in performing an analysis in high-dimensional genomic and proteomic
data.},

abstract = {Key processes during recruitment of Quercus petraea and Corylus avellana were investigated in abandoned calcareous grasslands and adjacent scrub using the following methods: (1) observation of hoarding animals during the main period of ripening of acorns and hazel nuts, (2) exposition of seeds on the soil surface and in 56 cm depth to test differences in predation and germination, and (3) mapping of seedlings in the grasslands. European jays (Garrulus glandarius) and mice were the main disperser of seeds. Jays preferred acorns, whereas the rodents were less selective, but probably more important for dispersal of nuts. The maximum dispersal distance was about 1020 m for mice and was estimated several hundred metres for jays. Mice collected hoards of several seeds in about 2 cm depth in the soil, whereas jays stored single seeds. Seed predation and probably hoarding by mice were highest under scrub and in unmown grassland, while jays preferred mown sites for hoarding. However, hiding of seeds in the soil reduced losses in all sites. Predation of nuts was slightly less intensive than that of acorns. Seeds of Corylus were more sensitive to desiccation than Quercus, but in both species germination was lower for seeds exposed on the soil surface and in drier sites. Quercus and Corylus were the most abundant woody species in the fallow grasslands, probably due to the effective multi-staged dispersal by jays and mice, whereas wind-dispersed and fleshy-fruited species were less common; the latter restricted to margins of adjacent scrubland. The study provides several examples for discordance in suitability of patches for seeds and seedlings due to different habitat requirements of successive developmental stages. This result emphasizes the need for studies in the multiple stages during recruitment of vertebrate-dispersed plants.},

Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, o -the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. S V Mlight1 is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for S V MlightV2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains},

abstract = {While evidence-based medicine has increasingly broad-based support
in health care, it remains difficult to get physicians to actually
practice it. Across most domains in medicine, practice has lagged
behind knowledge by at least several years. The authors believe that
the key tools for closing this gap will be information systems that
provide decision support to users at the time they make decisions,
which should result in improved quality of care. Furthermore, providers
make many errors, and clinical decision support can be useful for
finding and preventing such errors. Over the last eight years the
authors have implemented and studied the impact of decision support
across a broad array of domains and have found a number of common
elements important to success. The goal of this report is to discuss
these lessons learned in the interest of informing the efforts of
others working to make the practice of evidence-based medicine a
reality.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection systems are developed by learning a baseline-model
from a set of events captured from a computer system operating under
normal conditions. The model is then used to recognize unusual activities
as deviations from normality. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful
probabilistic finite state machines that have been used to acquire
these baseline-models. Although previous research has indicated that
HMMs can effectively represent complex sequences, the traditional
learning algorithm for HMMs is too computationally expensive for
use with real-world anomaly detection systems. This paper describes
the use of a novel incremental learning algorithm for HMMs that allows
the efficient acquisition of anomaly detection models. The new learning
algorithm requires less memory and training time than previous approaches
for learning discrete HMMs and can be used to perform online learning
of accurate baseline-models from complex computer applications to
support anomaly detection.},

abstract = {This chapter about the recognition, treatment, and prevention of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on
Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines.
Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits
do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests
that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for
a full understanding of the grading, see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004;
126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are
the following: For patients in whom the risk of HIT is considered
to be > 0.1\%, we recommend platelet count monitoring (Grade 1C).
For patients who are receiving therapeutic-dose unfractionated heparin
(UFH), we suggest at least every-other-day platelet count monitoring
until day 14, or until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first (Grade
2C). For patients who are receiving postoperative antithrombotic
prophylaxis with UFH (HIT risk > 1\%), we suggest at least every-other-day
platelet count monitoring between postoperative days 4 to 14 (or
until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first) [Grade 2C]. For medical/obstetric
patients who are receiving prophylactic-dose UFH, postoperative patients
receiving prophylactic-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),
postoperative patients receiving intravascular catheter UFH "flushes,"
or medical/obstetrical patients receiving LMWH after first receiving
UFH (risk, 0.1 to 1\%), we suggest platelet count monitoring every
2 days or 3 days from day 4 to day 14, or until heparin is stopped,
whichever occurs first (Grade 2C). For medical/obstetrical patients
who are only receiving LMWH, or medical patients who are receiving
only intravascular catheter UFH flushes (risk < 0.1\%), we suggest
clinicians do not use routine platelet count monitoring (Grade 2C).
For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, whether
or not complicated by thrombosis, we recommend use of an alternative
anticoagulant, such as lepirudin (Grade 1C+), argatroban (Grade 1C),
bivalirudin (Grade 2C), or danaparoid (Grade 1B). For patients with
strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, we recommend routine ultrasonography
of the lower-limb veins for investigation of deep venous thrombosis
(Grade 1C); against the use of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [coumarin]
therapy until after the platelet count has substantially recovered;
that the VKA antagonist be administered only during overlapping alternative
anticoagulation (minimum 5-day overlap); and begun with low, maintenance
doses (all Grade 2C). For patients receiving VKAs at the time of
diagnosis of HIT, we recommend use of vitamin K (Grade 2C) [corrected]
For patients with a history of HIT who are HIT antibody negative
and require cardiac surgery, we recommend use of UFH (Grade 1C).},

abstract = {Training a support vector machine (SVM) leads to a quadratic optimization problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, o -the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. S V Mlight1 is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for S V MlightV2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains},

@article{hart2011identification,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to provide a univariate and multivariate
analysis of genomic microbial data and salivary mass-spectrometry
proteomic profiles for dental caries outcomes. In order to determine
potential useful biomarkers for dental caries, a multivariate classification
analysis was employed to build predictive models capable of classifying
microbial and salivary sample profiles with generalization performance.
We used high-throughput methodologies including multiplexed microbial
arrays and SELDI-TOF-MS profiling to characterize the oral flora
and salivary proteome in 204 children aged 1-8 years (n = 118 caries-free,
n = 86 caries-active). The population received little dental care
and was deemed at high risk for childhood caries. Findings of the
study indicate that models incorporating both microbial and proteomic
data are superior to models of only microbial or salivary data alone.
Comparison of results for the combined and independent data suggests
that the combination of proteomic and microbial sources is beneficial
for the classification accuracy and that combined data lead to improved
predictive models for caries-active and caries-free patients. The
best predictive model had a 6\% test error, >92\% sensitivity, and
>95\% specificity. These findings suggest that further characterization
of the oral microflora and the salivary proteome associated with
health and caries may provide clinically useful biomarkers to better
predict future caries experience.},

abstract = {The study of online convex optimization in the bandit setting was initiated by Klein- berg (2004) and Flaxman et al. (2005). Such a setting models a decision maker that has to make decisions in the face of adversari- ally chosen convex loss functions. Moreover, the only information the decision maker re- ceives are the losses. The identities of the loss functions themselves are not revealed. In this setting, we reduce the gap between the best known lower and upper bounds for the class of smooth convex functions, i.e. convex functions with a Lipschitz continuous gradi- ent. Building upon existing work on self- concordant regularizers and one-point gradi- ent estimation, we give the first algorithm whose expected regret is O(T2/3), ignoring constant and logarithmic factors.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of finding the best arm in a stochastic multi-armed bandit game. The regret of a forecaster is here defined by the gap between the mean reward of the optimal arm and the mean reward of the ultimately chosen arm. We propose a highly exploring UCB policy and a new algorithm based on successive rejects. We show that these algorithms are essentially optimal since their regret decreases exponentially at a rate which is, up to a logarithmic factor, the best possible. However, while the UCB policy needs the tuning of a parameter depending on the unobservable hardness of the task, the successive rejects policy benefits from being parameter-free, and also independent of the scaling of the rewards.},

@article{lo2006evaluation,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic
adverse drug reaction caused by heparin. As thrombocytopenia is common
in hospitalized patients receiving heparin, it would be useful to
have a clinical scoring system that could differentiate patients
with HIT from those with other reasons for thrombocytopenia. AIM:
To compare prospectively the diagnostic utility of a clinical score
for HIT in two different clinical settings. METHODS: The pretest
clinical scoring system, the '4 T's', was used to classify 100 consecutive
patients referred for possible HIT in one hospital (Hamilton General
Hospital, HGH) into high, intermediate, and low probability groups.
This system was also used to classify likewise 236 patients by clinicians
in Germany referring blood for diagnostic testing for HIT in Greifswald
(GW). The clinical scores were correlated with the results of laboratory
testing for HIT antibodies using the serologic criteria for HIT with
high diagnostic specificity. RESULTS: In both centers, patients with
low scores were unlikely to test positive for HIT antibodies [HGH:
1/64 (1.6\%), GW: 0/55 (0\%)]. Patients with intermediate [HGH: 8/28
(28.6\%), GW: 11/139 (7.9\%)] or high scores [HGH: 8/8 (100\%), GW:
9/42 (21.4\%)] were more likely to test positive for clinically significant
HIT antibodies. The positive predictive value of an intermediate
or high clinical score for clinically significant HIT antibodies
was higher at one center (HGH). CONCLUSIONS: A low pretest clinical
score for HIT seems to be suitable for ruling out HIT in most situations
(high-negative predictive value). The implications of an intermediate
or high score vary in different clinical settings.},

Important information is often contained in the relationships between

thus could be of great value for clinical and translational research.

abstract = {Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc) to individual users by making use of both content and user information. Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation. In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using previously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events. Results showed a 12.5\% click lift compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce.},

abstract = {A representation and interpretation of the area under a receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve obtained by the "rating" method, or by
mathematical predictions based on patient characteristics, is presented.
It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability
that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked
with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject.
Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity

closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling
variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the
area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size
of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate
of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be
to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy

abstract = {We consider a the general online convex optimization framework introduced by Zinkevich. In this setting, there is a sequence of convex functions. Each period, we must choose a signle point (from some feasible set) and pay a cost equal to the value of the next function on our chosen point. Zinkevich shows that, if the each function is revealed after the choice is made, then one can achieve vanishingly small regret relative the best single decision chosen in hindsight. We extend this to the bandit setting where we do not find out the entire functions but rather just their value at our chosen point. We show how to get vanishingly small regret in this setting. Our approach uses a simple approximation of the gradient that is computed from evaluating a function at a single (random) point. We show that this estimate is sufficient to mimic Zinkevich's gradient descent online analysis, with access to the gradient (only being able to evaluate the function at a single point).},

In our problem, we recognize only one person, and there are no labeled data for any other person. This setting naturally arises in authentication on personal computers and mobile devices, and poses additional challenges because it lacks negative examples. We formalize our problem as one-class classification, and propose and analyze an algorithm that learns a non-parametric model of the face from a single labeled image and a stream of unlabeled data. In many domains, for instance when a person interacts with a computer with a camera, unlabeled data are abundant and easy to utilize. This is the first paper that investigates how these data can help in learning better models in the single-image-per-person setting. Our method is evaluated on a dataset of 43 people and we show that these people can be recognized 90\% of time at nearly zero false positives. This recall is 25+\% higher than the recall of our best performing baseline. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of our algorithm and provide a guideline for setting its parameters in practice.},

This is exponentially faster than all previous algorithms that achieve optimal regret in this setting.

The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a new algorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension d while incurring regret at most O(sqrtT(dln(T) + ln (1/delta))) with probability \$1-delta. These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to providing supervised learning type guarantees for the contextual bandit setting.},

We rst characterize the set of all reward functions for which a given policy is optimal. We then derive three algorithms for IRL. The rst two deal with the case where the entire policy is known; we handle tabulated reward functions on a nite state space and linear functional approximation of the reward function over a potentially in- nite state space. The third algorithm deals with the more realistic case in which the policy is known only through a nite set of observed trajectories. In all cases, a key issue is degeneracythe existence of a large set of reward functions for which the observed policy is optimal. To remove...},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data
in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.
The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development
of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such
as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these
tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
terminology. This book descibes theimprtant ideas in these areas
ina common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical,
the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples
are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a vluable
resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in
science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised
learing (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include
neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.
Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors
of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers
in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive
models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much
of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal
curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author
of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman
is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,
and projection pursuit.},

When data is abundant or arrive in a stream, the problems of computation and data storage arise for any graph-based method. We propose a fast approximate online algorithm that solves for the harmonic solution on an approximate graph. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that good behavior can be achieved by collapsing nearby points into a set of local representative points that minimize distortion. Moreover, we regularize the harmonic solution to achieve better stability properties. We also present graph-based methods for detecting conditional anomalies and apply them to the identification of unusual clinical actions in hospitals. Our hypothesis is that patient-management actions that are unusual with respect to the past patients may be due to errors and that it is worthwhile to raise an alert if such a condition is encountered. Conditional anomaly detection extends standard unconditional anomaly framework but also faces new problems known as fringe and isolated points. We devise novel nonparametric graph-based methods to tackle these problems. Our methods rely on graph connectivity analysis and soft harmonic solution. Finally, we conduct an extensive human evaluation study of our conditional anomaly methods by 15 experts in critical care.},

remaining attributes. The work presented in this paper focuses on
instance-based methods for detecting conditional anomalies. The methods
depend heavily on the distance metric that lets us identify examples
in the dataset that are most critical for detecting the anomaly.
To optimize the performance of the anomaly detection methods we explore
and study metric learning methods. We evaluate the quality of our
methods on the Pneumonia PORT dataset by detecting unusual admission
decisions for patients with the community-acquired pneumonia. The
results of our metric learning methods show an improved detection
performance over standard distance metrics, which is very promising

The strategies are assessed in terms of their simple regret, a regret notion that captures the fact that exploration is only constrained by the number of available rounds (not necessarily known in advance), in contrast to the case when the cumulative regret is considered and when exploitation needs to be performed at the same time. We believe that this performance criterion is suited to situations when the cost of pulling an arm is expressed in terms of resources rather than rewards. We discuss the links between the simple and the cumulative regret. The main result is that the required explorationexploitation trade-offs are qualitatively different, in view of a general lower bound on the simple regret in terms of the cumulative regret.},

abstract = {Various supervised inference methods can be analyzed as convex duals of the generalized maximum entropy (MaxEnt) framework. Generalized MaxEnt aims to find a distribution that maximizes an entropy function while respecting prior information represented as potential functions in miscellaneous forms of constraints and/or penalties. We extend this framework to semi-supervised learning by incorporating unlabeled data via modifications to these potential functions reflecting structural assumptions on the data geometry. The proposed approach leads to a family of discriminative semi-supervised algorithms, that are convex, scalable, inherently multi-class, easy to implement, and that can be kernelized naturally. Experimental evaluation of special cases shows the competitiveness of our methodology.},

abstract = {The formalism of probabilistic graphical models provides a unifying
framework for the development of large-scale multivariate statistical
models. Graphical models have become a focus of research in many
applied statistical and computational fields, including bioinformatics,
information theory, signal and image processing, information retrieval
and machine learning. Many problems that arise in specific instances???including
the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability
distributions???are best studied in the general setting. Working with
exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate
duality between the cumulant generating function and the entropy
for exponential families, we develop general variational representations
of the problems of computing marginal probabilities and modes. We
describe how a wide variety of known computational algorithms???including
mean field methods and cluster variational techniques???can be understood
in terms of approximations of these variational representations.
We also present novel convex relaxations based on the variational
framework. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative
to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation
methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.},

technology and the global superhighways of communication, resulting
in the loss of billions of dollars worldwide each year. Although
prevention technologies are the best way to reduce fraud, fraudsters
are adaptive and, given time, will usually find ways to circumvent
such measures. Methodologies for the detection of fraud are essential
if we are to catch fraudsters once fraud prevention has failed. Statistics
and machine learning provide effective technologies for fraud detection
and have been applied successfully to detect activities such as money
laundering, e-commerce credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud
and computer intrusion, to name but a few. We describe the tools
available for statistical fraud detection and the areas in which
fraud detection technologies are most used.},

IRL is motivated by situations where knowledge of the rewards is a goal by itself (as in preference elicitation) and by the task of apprenticeship learning (learning policies from an expert). In this paper we show how to combine prior knowledge and evidence from the expert's actions to derive a probability distribution over the space of reward functions. We present efficient algorithms that find solutions for the reward learning and apprenticeship learning tasks that generalize well over these distributions. Experimental results show strong improvement for our methods over previous heuristic-based approaches.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of imitation learning where the examples, demonstrated by an expert, cover only a small part of a large state space. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) provides an efficient tool for generalizing the demonstration, based on the assumption that the expert is optimally acting in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Past work on IRL requires that an accurate model of the underlying MDP is known. However, this requirement can hardly be satisfied in practice, as learning a model of a dynamical system with a large, or continuous, state space is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a model-free IRL algorithm, where the relative entropy between the empirical distribution of the trajectories under a uniform policy and their distribution under the learned policy is minimized by stochastic gradient descent. We compare this new approach to well-known IRL algorithms using approximate MDP models. Empirical results on simulated car racing, gridworld and ball-in-a-cup problems show that our approach is able to learn good policies from a small number of demonstrations.},

In this model, the algorithm is allowed to observed noisy realizations of the function value f(x) at any query point x in xset. The quantity of interest is regret of the algorithm, which is the sum of the function values at algorithm's query points minus the optimal function value. We demonstrate a generalization of the ellipsoid algorithm that incurs otil(poly(d)sqrtT) regret. Since any algorithm has regret at least Omega(sqrtT) on this problem, our algorithm is optimal in terms of the scaling with T.},

abstract = {Alerts and prompts represent promising types of decision support in
electronic prescribing to tackle inadequacies in prescribing. A systematic
review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of computerized drug
alerts and prompts searching EMBASE, CINHAL, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO
up to May 2007. Studies assessing the impact of electronic alerts
and prompts on clinicians' prescribing behavior were selected and
categorized by decision support type. Most alerts and prompts (23
out of 27) demonstrated benefit in improving prescribing behavior
and/or reducing error rates. The impact appeared to vary based on
the type of decision support. Some of these alerts (n = 5) reported
a positive impact on clinical and health service management outcomes.
For many categories of reminders, the number of studies was very
small and few data were available from the outpatient setting. None
of the studies evaluated features that might make alerts and prompts
more effective. Details of an updated search run in Jan 2009 are
included in the supplement section of this review.},

The statistics used in this detection are derived from probabilistic models such as Bayesian networks that are learned from a database of past patient cases. We evaluate our methods on the problem of detection of unusual hospitalization patterns for patients with community acquired pneumonia. The results show very encouraging detection performance with 0.5 precision at 0.53 recall and give us hope that these techniques may provide the basis of intelligent monitoring systems that alert clinicians to the occurrence of unusual events or decisions.},

For integer valued submodular functions, the algorithm runs in O(n6EO log nM) time, where n is the cardinality of the ground set, M is the maximum absolute value of the function value, and EO is the time for function evaluation. The algorithm can be improved to run in O ((n4EO+n5)log nM) time. The strongly polynomial version of this faster algorithm runs in O((n5EO + n6) log n) time for real valued general submodular functions. These are comparable to the best known running time bounds for submodular function minimization. The algorithm can also be implemented in strongly polynomial time using only additions, subtractions, comparisons, and the oracle calls for function evaluation. This is the first fully combinatorial submodular function minimization algorithm that does not rely on the scaling method.},

abstract = {We consider a generalization of stochastic bandits where the set of arms, cX, is allowed to be a generic measurable space and the mean-payoff function is "locally Lipschitz" with respect to a dissimilarity function that is known to the decision maker. Under this condition we construct an arm selection policy, called HOO (hierarchical optimistic optimization), with improved regret bounds compared to previous results for a large class of problems. In particular, our results imply that if cX is the unit hypercube in a Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally continuous with a known smoothness degree, then the expected regret of HOO is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by sqrtn, i.e., the rate of growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. We also prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm when the dissimilarity is a metric. Our basic strategy has quadratic computational complexity as a function of the number of time steps and does not rely on the doubling trick. We also introduce a modified strategy, which relies on the doubling trick but runs in linearithmic time. Both results are improvements with respect to previous approaches.},

In this work, we study two data sources to measure the expression of protein mixtures in the human body: whole-sample MS profiling and multiplexed protein arrays. We investigate the individual and combined utility of these technologies by learning and testing a variety of classification models on the data from a pancreatic cancer study. We show that for the combination of these two (heterogeneous) datasets, classification models that work well on one of them individually fail on the combination of the two datasets. We study and propose a class of model fusion methods that acknowledge the differences and try to reap most of the benefits from their combination.},

In this paper, we consider the setting where we observe many sample trajectories (i.e., sequences of states) but only one or a few of them are labeled as experts' trajectories. We investigate the conditions under which the remaining unlabeled trajectories can help in learning a policy with a good performance. In particular, we define an extension to the max-margin inverse reinforcement learning proposed by Abbeel and Ng (2004) where, at each iteration, the max-margin optimization step is replaced by a semi-supervised optimization problem which favors classifiers separating clusters of trajectories. Finally, we report empirical results on two grid-world domains showing that the semi-supervised algorithm is able to output a better policy in fewer iterations than the related algorithm that does not take the unlabeled trajectories into account.},

abstract = {Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.},

@article{slivkins2009contextual,
abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, an online algorithm makes a sequence of choices. In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms. We consider similarity information in the setting of "contextual bandits", a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the "context" - a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a "similarity distance" between the context-arm pairs which gives an upper bound on the difference between the respective expected payoffs. Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses "uniform" partitions of the similarity space, which is potentially wasteful. We design more efficient algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions adjusted to "popular" context and "high-payoff" arms.},

This approach reduces the problem of learning to recovering a utility function that makes the behavior induced by a near-optimal policy closely mimic demonstrated behavior.

Our approach provides a well-defined, globally normalized distribution over decisions, while providing the same performance guarantees as existing methods.We develop our technique in the context of modeling real-world navigation and driving behaviors where collected data is inherently noisy and imperfect. Our probabilistic approach enables modeling of route preferences as well as a powerful new approach to inferring destinations and routes based on partial trajectories.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection methods can be very useful in identifying unusual
or interesting patterns in data. A recently proposed conditional
anomaly detection framework extends anomaly detection to the problem
of identifying anomalous patterns on a subset of attributes in the
data. The anomaly always depends (is conditioned) on the value of
remaining attributes. The work presented in this paper focuses on
instance-based methods for detecting conditional anomalies. The methods
rely on the distance metric to identify examples in the dataset that
are most critical for detecting the anomaly. We investigate various
metrics and metric learning methods to optimize the performance of
the instance-based anomaly detection methods. We show the benefits
of the instance-based methods on two real-world detection problems:
detection of unusual admission decisions for patients with the community-acquired
pneumonia and detection of unusual orders of an HPF4 test that is
used to confirm Heparin induced thrombocytopenia - a life-threatening
condition caused by the Heparin therapy.},

abstract = {We develop and evaluate a data-driven approach for detecting unusual (anomalous) patient-management actions using past patient cases stored in an electronic health record (EHR) system. Our hypothesis is that patient-management actions that are unusual with respect to past patients may be due to a potential error and that it is worthwhile to raise an alert if such a condition is encountered. We evaluate this hypothesis using data obtained from the electronic health records of 4,486 post-cardiac surgical patients. We base the evaluation on the opinions of a panel of experts. The results support that anomaly-based alerting can have reasonably low false alert rates and that stronger anomalies are correlated with higher alert rates.},

We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

abstract = {Decision making in robotics often involves computing an optimal action for a given state, where the space of actions under consideration can potentially be large and state dependent. Many of these decision making problems can be naturally formalized in the multiclass classification framework, where actions are regarded as labels for states. One powerful approach to multiclass classification relies on learning a function that scores each action; action selection is done by returning the action with maximum score. In this work, we focus on two imitation learning problems in particular that arise in robotics. The first problem is footstep prediction for quadruped locomotion, in which the system predicts next footstep locations greedily given the current four-foot configuration of the robot over a terrain height map. The second problem is grasp prediction, in which the system must predict good grasps of complex free-form objects given an approach direction for a robotic hand. We present experimental results of applying a recently developed functional gradient technique for optimizing a structured margin formulation of the corresponding large non-linear multiclass classification problems.},

@article{isaac2009overrides,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic prescribing systems with decision support may
improve patient safety in ambulatory care by offering drug allergy
and drug interaction alerts. However, preliminary studies show that
clinicians override most of these alerts. METHODS: We performed a
retrospective analysis of 233 537 medication safety alerts generated
by 2872 clinicians in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
who used a common electronic prescribing system from January 1, 2006,
through September 30, 2006. We used multivariate techniques to examine
factors associated with alert acceptance. RESULTS: A total of 6.6\%
of electronic prescription attempts generated alerts. Clinicians
accepted 9.2\% of drug interaction alerts and 23.0\% of allergy alerts.
High-severity interactions accounted for most alerts (61.6\%); clinicians
accepted high-severity alerts slightly more often than moderate-
or low-severity interaction alerts (10.4\%, 7.3\%, and 7.1\%, respectively;
P < .001). Clinicians accepted 2.2\% to 43.1\% of high-severity interaction
alerts, depending on the classes of interacting medications. In multivariable
analyses, we found no difference in alert acceptance among clinicians
of different specialties (P = .16). Clinicians were less likely to
accept a drug interaction alert if the patient had previously received
the alerted medication (odds ratio, 0.03; 95\% confidence interval,
0.03-0.03). CONCLUSION: Clinicians override most medication alerts,
suggesting that current medication safety alerts may be inadequate
to protect patient safety.},

We frame learning such behaviors as a maximum margin structured prediction problem over a space of policies. In this approach, we learn mappings from features to cost so an optimal policy in an MDP with these cost mimics the expert's behavior. Further, we demonstrate a simple, provably efficient approach to structured maximum margin learning, based on the subgradient method, that leverages existing fast algorithms for inference. Although the technique is general, it is particularly relevant in problems where A and dynamic programming approaches make learning policies tractable in problems beyond the limitations of a QP formulation. We demonstrate our approach applied to route planning for outdoor mobile robots, where the behavior a designer wishes a planner to execute is often clear, while specifying cost functions that engender this behavior is a much more difficult task.},

abstract = {We consider the framework of stochastic multi-armed bandit problems and study the possibilities and limitations of strategies that perform an online exploration of the arms. The strategies are assessed in terms of their simple regret, a regret notion that captures the fact that exploration is only constrained by the number of available rounds (not necessarily known in advance), in contrast to the case when the cumulative regret is considered and when exploitation needs to be performed at the same time. We believe that this performance criterion is suited to situations when the cost of pulling an arm is expressed in terms of resources rather than rewards. We discuss the links between the simple and the cumulative regret. The main result is that the required explorationexploitation trade-offs are qualitatively different, in view of a general lower bound on the simple regret in terms of the cumulative regret.},

abstract = {If one possesses a model of a controlled deterministic system, then from any state, one may consider the set of all possible reachable states starting from that state and using any sequence of actions. This forms a tree whose size is exponential in the planning time horizon. Here we ask the question: given finite computational resources (e.g. CPU time), which may not be known ahead of time, what is the best way to explore this tree, such that once all resources have been used, the algorithm would be able to propose an action (or a sequence of actions) whose performance is as close as possible to optimality? The performance with respect to optimality is assessed in terms of the regret (with respect to the sum of discounted future rewards) resulting from choosing the action returned by the algorithm instead of an optimal action. In this paper we investigate an optimistic exploration of the tree, where the most promising states are explored first, and compare this approach to a naive uniform exploration. Bounds on the regret are derived both for uniform and optimistic exploration strategies. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefit of optimistic planning.},

The setting is a natural generalization of the non-stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, and the existence of an efficient optimal algorithm has been posed as an open problem in a number of recent papers. We show how the difficulties encountered by previous approaches are overcome by the use of a self-concordant potential function. Our approach presents a novel connection between online learning and interior point methods.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of finding the best arm in a stochastic multi-armed bandit game. The regret of a forecaster is here defined by the gap between the mean reward of the optimal arm and the mean reward of the ultimately chosen arm. We propose a highly exploring UCB policy and a new algorithm based on successive rejects. We show that these algorithms are essentially optimal since their regret decreases exponentially at a rate which is, up to a logarithmic factor, the best possible. However, while the UCB policy needs the tuning of a parameter depending on the unobservable hardness of the task, the successive rejects policy benefits from being parameter-free, and also independent of the scaling of the rewards.},

@article{slivkins2009contextual,
abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, an online algorithm makes a sequence of choices. In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms. We consider similarity information in the setting of "contextual bandits", a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the "context" - a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a "similarity distance" between the context-arm pairs which gives an upper bound on the difference between the respective expected payoffs. Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses "uniform" partitions of the similarity space, which is potentially wasteful. We design more efficient algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions adjusted to "popular" context and "high-payoff" arms.},

abstract = {We address the problem of learning in an online setting where the learner repeatedly observes features, selects among a set of actions, and receives reward for the action taken. We provide the first efficient algorithm with an optimal regret. Our algorithm uses a cost sensitive classification learner as an oracle and has a running time mathrmpolylog(N), where N is the number of classification rules among which the oracle might choose. This is exponentially faster than all previous algorithms that achieve optimal regret in this setting. Our formulation also enables us to create an algorithm with regret that is additive rather than multiplicative in feedback delay as in all previous work.},

abstract = {Many applications require optimizing an unknown, noisy function that is expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

abstract = {We address the problem of learning in an online, bandit setting where the learner must repeatedly select among K actions, but only receives partial feedback based on its choices. We establish two new facts: First, using a new algorithm called Exp4.P, we show that it is possible to compete with the best in a set of N experts with probability \$1-delta while incurring regret at most O(sqrtKTln(N/delta)) over T time steps. The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a new algorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension d while incurring regret at most O(sqrtT(dln(T) + ln (1/delta))) with probability \$1-delta. These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to providing supervised learning type guarantees for the contextual bandit setting.},

We describe two algorithms based on optimistic exploration that use a hierarchical partitioning of the space at all scales. A first contribution is an algorithm, DOO, that requires the knowledge of . We report a finite-sample performance bound in terms of a measure of the quantity of near-optimal states. We then define a second algorithm, SOO, which does not require the knowledge of the semi-metric under which f is smooth, and whose performance is almost as good as DOO optimally-fitted.},
