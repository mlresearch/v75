\section{Discussion}\label{s:disc}
We list some future potential questions to 
investigate.
 Can we take into account in our 
strategies higher moments of the rewards 
sequence~\citep{Mnih08EB}? 
%Is there a crisp 
%formulation of the problem against adaptive 
%adversaries? 
As \cite{Karnin13AO,Carpentier16TB} 
can we obtain tighter upper and lower bound with 
the right amount of $\log\nArms$ factors?
We are also especially interested by extension 
to continuous arms problem.
