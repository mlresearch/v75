	Abstract = {Control design for stochastic systems is traditionally based on optimization of the expected value of a suitably chosen loss function. Despite the theoretical attractiveness of such a design methodology, its applicability is very limited owing to its computational overhead. Thus it is worthwhile to seek an alternative formulation resulting in a more tractable design. In this paper, an alternative is presented that leads to a simpler form of design equations. The proposed controller minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between the actual probabilistic descriptions of the closed-loop behaviour and the desired one. Its explicit randomized form depends on the solution of a functional equation with a simpler structure than that of the general dynamic programming equations. A basic paradigm is proposed, and the resulting algorithm is discussed. For illustration purposes, it is applied to linear Gaussian systems, and the desired result is obtained: The optimal controller is determined by a discrete-time Riccati equation.},

	Abstract = {Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power have a high degree of unpredictability and time-variation, which makes balancing demand and supply challenging. One possible way to address this challenge is to harness the inherent flexibility in demand of many types of loads. Introduced in this paper is a technique for decentralized control for automated demand response that can be used by grid operators as ancillary service for maintaining demand-supply balance. A randomized control architecture is proposed, motivated by the need for decentralized decision making, and the need to avoid synchronization that can lead to large and detrimental spikes in demand. An aggregate model for a large number of loads is then developed by examining the mean field limit. A key innovation is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system approximation of the aggregate nonlinear model, with a scalar signal as the input and a measure of the aggregate demand as the output. This makes the approximation particularly convenient for control design at the grid level.},
