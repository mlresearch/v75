In the next subsection we establish the notation and assumptions that we use throughout the paper. In Section \ref{s:resultsmain} we present the discretized version of \eqref{e:exactlangevindiffusion} and state our main results for convergence to the invariant distribution. Section \ref{s:exactconvergence} then establishes exponential convergence for the continuous-time process and in Section \ref{s:discreteerror} we show how to control the discretization error. Finally in Section \ref{s:discreteconvergence} we prove the convergence of the discretization \eqref{e:exactlangevindiffusion}. We defer technical lemmas to the appendix.
