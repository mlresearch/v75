abstract = {In the present work,  we give a solution to the following  question from manifold learning. 
Suppose data belonging to a high dimensional Euclidean space is drawn independently, identically distributed  from a measure supported on a low dimensional twice  differentiable embedded manifold M, and corrupted by a small amount of  gaussian noise.
How can we produce a manifold M' whose Hausdorff distance to M is small and whose reach is not much smaller than the reach of M?}
