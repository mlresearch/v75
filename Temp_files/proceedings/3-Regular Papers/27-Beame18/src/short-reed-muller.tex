\section{Applications to Learning Polynomial Functions over Finite Fields}

We give the applications of the SDP strategy to bound the norm amplication
curves of the matrices for polynomial evaluations over
$\mathbb{F}_2$ and $\mathbb{F}_p$
in the full paper in the appendix by connecting the strategy to the
distribution of biases of degree $d$ polynomials
(equivalently, the weight distributions of Reed-Muller codes). 
We do this in two ways: via a precise characterization of the bias of
quadratic polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$~\cite{DBLP:journals/tit/SloaneB70} 
and, for larger degrees, we use bounds on the bias of random degree $d$
polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$ developed by Ben-Eliezer,
Hod, and Lovett~\cite{DBLP:journals/cc/Ben-EliezerHL12} for the purpose of 
analyzing the properties of Reed-Muller codes over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
We extend this to the linear and quadratic cases over $\mathbb{F}_p$ for odd
prime $p$, again via precise characterizations of the (complex) biases and
now using the complex version of the SDP strategy,
