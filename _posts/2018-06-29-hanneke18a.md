title: Actively Avoiding Nonsense in Generative Models
abstract: 'A generative model may generate utter nonsense when it is fit to maximize
  the likelihood of observed data. This happens due to “model error,” i.e., when the
  true data generating distribution does not fit within the class of generative models
  being learned. To address this, we propose a model of active distribution learning
  using a binary invalidity oracle that identifies some examples as clearly invalid,
  together with random positive examples sampled from the true distribution. The goal
  is to maximize the likelihood of the positive examples subject to the constraint
  of (almost) never generating examples labeled invalid by the oracle. Guarantees
  are agnostic compared to a class of probability distributions. We first show that
  proper learning may require exponentially many queries to the invalidity oracle.
  We then give an improper distribution learning algorithm that uses only polynomially
  many queries. '
