title: Approximation beats concentration? An approximation view  on inference with
  smooth radial kernels
abstract: 'Positive definite kernels and their associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
  Spaces provide a mathematically compelling and practically competitive framework
  for learning from data.  In this paper we take the approximation theory point of
  view to explore various aspects of  smooth kernels related to their inferential
  properties. We  analyze eigenvalue decay of  kernels operators and  matrices,  properties
  of eigenfunctions/eigenvectors and “Fourier” coefficients of functions in the kernel
  space restricted to a discrete set of data points. We also investigate the fitting
  capacity of kernels,  giving explicit bounds on the fat shattering dimension of
  the balls in  Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces.  Interestingly, the same properties
  that make kernels  very effective approximators for functions in their “native”
  kernel space,  also limit their capacity to represent arbitrary functions.  We discuss
  various implications, including those for gradient descent type methods. It is important
  to note that most of our  bounds are measure independent.  Moreover,  at least in
  moderate dimension, the bounds for eigenvalues are much tighter than the bounds
  which can be obtained from the usual matrix concentration results. For example,
  we see that  eigenvalues of kernel matrices show nearly exponential decay with constants
  depending only on the kernel and the domain. We call this “approximation beats concentration”
  phenomenon as even when the data are sampled from a probability distribution, some
  of their aspects are better understood in terms of approximation theory.  '
