title: Restricted Eigenvalue from Stable Rank with Applications to Sparse Linear Regression
abstract: 'High-dimensional settings, where the data dimension ($d$) far exceeds the
  number of observations ($n$), are common in many statistical and machine learning
  applications. Methods based on $\ell_1$-relaxation, such as Lasso, are very popular
  for sparse recovery in these settings. Restricted Eigenvalue (RE) condition is among
  the weakest, and hence the most general, condition in literature imposed on the
  Gram matrix that guarantees nice statistical properties for the Lasso estimator.
  It is hence natural to ask: what families of matrices satisfy the RE condition?  Following
  a line of work in this area, we construct a new broad ensemble of dependent random
  design matrices that have an explicit RE bound. Our construction starts with a fixed
  (deterministic) matrix $X ∈\mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ satisfying a simple stable rank
  condition, and we show that a matrix drawn from the distribution $X Φ^⊤Φ$, where
  $Φ∈\mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ is a subgaussian random matrix, with high probability,
  satisfies the RE condition. This construction allows incorporating a fixed matrix
  that has an easily {\em verifiable} condition into the design process, and allows
  for generation of {\em compressed} design matrices that have a lower storage requirement
  than a standard design matrix. We give two applications of this construction to
  sparse linear regression problems, including one to a compressed sparse regression
  setting where the regression algorithm only has access to a compressed representation
  of a fixed design matrix $X$.'
