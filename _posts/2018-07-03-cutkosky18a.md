title: Black-Box Reductions for Parameter-free Online Learning in Banach Spaces
abstract: We introduce several new black-box reductions that significantly improve
  the design of adaptive and parameter-free online learning algorithms by simplifying
  analysis, improving regret guarantees, and sometimes even improving runtime. We
  reduce parameter-free online learning to online exp-concave optimization, we reduce
  optimization in a Banach space to one-dimensional optimization, and we reduce optimization
  over a constrained domain to unconstrained optimization. All of our reductions run
  as fast as online gradient descent. We use our new techniques to improve upon the
  previously best regret bounds for parameter-free learning, and do so for arbitrary
  norms.
