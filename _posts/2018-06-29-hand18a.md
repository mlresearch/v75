title: Global Guarantees for Enforcing Deep Generative Priors by Empirical Risk
abstract: We examine the theoretical properties of enforcing priors provided by generative
  deep neural networks via empirical risk minimization. In particular we consider
  two models, one in which the task is to invert a generative neural network given
  access to its last layer and another in which the task is to invert a generative
  neural network given only compressive linear observations of its last layer.  We
  establish that in both cases, in suitable regimes of network layer sizes and a randomness
  assumption on the network weights, that the non-convex objective function given
  by empirical risk minimization does not have any spurious stationary points. That
  is, we establish that with high probability, at any point away from small neighborhoods
  around two scalar multiples of the desired solution, there is a descent direction.
  Hence, there are no local minima, saddle points, or other stationary points outside
  these neighborhoods.  These results constitute the first theoretical guarantees
  which establish the favorable global geometry of these non-convex optimization problems,
  and they bridge the gap between the empirical success of  enforcing deep generative
  priors and a rigorous understanding of non-linear inverse problems.
