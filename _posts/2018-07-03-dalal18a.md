title: Finite Sample Analysis of Two-Timescale Stochastic Approximation with Applications
  to Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Two-timescale Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithms are widely used in
  Reinforcement Learning (RL). Their iterates have two parts that are updated using
  distinct stepsizes. In this work, we develop a novel recipe for their finite sample
  analysis. Using this, we provide a concentration bound, which is the first such
  result for a two-timescale SA. The type of bound we obtain is known as “lock-in
  probability”. We also introduce a new projection scheme, in which the time between
  successive projections increases exponentially. This scheme allows one to elegantly
  transform a lock-in probability into a convergence rate result for projected two-timescale
  SA. From this latter result, we then extract key insights on stepsize selection.  As
  an application, we finally obtain convergence rates for the projected two-timescale
  RL algorithms GTD(0), GTD2, and TDC.
