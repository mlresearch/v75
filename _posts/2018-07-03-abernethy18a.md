title: Faster Rates for Convex-Concave Games
abstract: 'We consider the use of no-regret algorithms to compute equilibria for particular
  classes of convex-concave games. While standard regret bounds would lead to convergence
  rates on the order of $O(T^{-1/2})$, recent work \citep{RS13,SALS15} has established
  $O(1/T)$ rates by taking advantage of a particular class of optimistic prediction
  algorithms. In this work we go further, showing that for a particular class of games
  one achieves a $O(1/T^2)$ rate, and we show how this applies to the Frank-Wolfe
  method and recovers a similar bound \citep{D15}. We also show that such no-regret
  techniques can even achieve a linear rate, $O(\exp(-T))$, for equilibrium computation
  under additional curvature assumptions. '
