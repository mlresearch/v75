title: 'The Mean-Field Approximation: Information Inequalities, Algorithms, and Complexity'
abstract: 'The mean field approximation to the Ising model is a canonical variational
  tool that is used for analysis and inference in Ising models. We provide a simple
  and optimal bound for the KL error of the mean field approximation for Ising models
  on general graphs, and extend it to higher order Markov random fields. Our bound
  improves on previous bounds obtained in work in the graph limit literature by Borgs,
  Chayes, Lovász, Sós, and Vesztergombi and recent works by Basak and Mukherjee, and
  Eldan. Our bound is tight up to lower order terms.  Building on the methods used
  to prove the bound, along with techniques from combinatorics and optimization,  we
  study the algorithmic problem of estimating the (variational) free energy for Ising
  models and general Markov random fields. For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and interaction
  matrix $J$ with Frobenius norm $\|J \|_F$, we provide algorithms that approximate
  the free energy within an additive error of $εn \|J\|_F$ in time $\exp(poly(1/ε))$.
  We also show that approximation within $(n \|J\|_F)^1-δ$ is NP-hard for every $δ>
  0$. Finally, we provide more efficient approximation algorithms, which find the
  optimal mean field approximation, for ferromagnetic Ising models and for Ising models
  satisfying Dobrushin’s condition.   '
