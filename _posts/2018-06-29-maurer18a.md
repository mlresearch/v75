title: Empirical bounds for functions with weak interactions
abstract: We provide sharp empirical estimates of expectation, variance and normal
  approximation for a class of statistics whose variation in any argument does not
  change too much when another argument is modified. Examples of such weak interactions
  are furnished by U- and V-statistics, Lipschitz L-statistics and various error functionals
  of $\ell_2$-regularized algorithms and Gibbs algorithms.
