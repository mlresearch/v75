title: 'Log-concave sampling: Metropolis-Hastings algorithms are fast!'
abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a strongly log-concave density
  in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and prove a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mixing time of
  the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA). The method draws samples by running
  a Markov chain obtained from the discretization of an appropriate Langevin diffusion,
  combined with an accept-reject step to ensure the correct stationary distribution.
  Relative to known guarantees for the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), our bounds
  reveal that the use of an accept-reject step in MALA leads to an exponentially improved
  dependence on the error-tolerance. Concretely, in order to obtain samples with TV
  error at most $δ$ for a density with condition number $κ$, we show that MALA requires
  $\mathcal{O} \big(κd \log(1/δ) \big)$ steps, as compared to the $\mathcal{O} \big(κ^2
  d/δ^2 \big)$ steps established in past work on ULA.  We also demonstrate the gains
  of MALA over ULA for weakly log-concave densities.  Furthermore, we derive mixing
  time bounds for a zeroth-order method Metropolized random walk (MRW) and show that
  it mixes $\mathcal{O}(κd)$ slower than MALA.
