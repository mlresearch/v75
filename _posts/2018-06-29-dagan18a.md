title: Detecting Correlations with Little Memory and Communication
abstract: 'We study the problem of identifying correlations in multivariate data,
  under information constraints: Either on the amount of memory that can be used by
  the algorithm, or the amount of communication when the data is distributed across
  several machines. We prove a tight trade-off between the memory/communication complexity
  and the sample complexity, implying (for example) that to detect pairwise correlations
  with optimal sample complexity, the number of required memory/communication bits
  is at least quadratic in the dimension. Our results substantially improve those
  of Shamir (2014), which studied a similar question in a much more restricted setting.
  To the best of our knowledge, these are the first provable sample/memory/communication
  trade-offs for a practical estimation problem, using standard distributions, and
  in the natural regime where the memory/communication budget is larger than the size
  of a single data point. To derive our theorems, we prove a new information-theoretic
  result, which may be relevant for studying other information-constrained learning
  problems.'
