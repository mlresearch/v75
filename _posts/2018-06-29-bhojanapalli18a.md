title: Smoothed analysis for low-rank solutions to semidefinite programs in quadratic
  penalty form
abstract: Semidefinite programs (SDP) are important in learning and combinatorial
  optimization with numerous applications. In pursuit of low-rank solutions and low
  complexity algorithms, we consider the Burerâ€“Monteiro factorization approach for
  solving SDPs. For a large class of SDPs, upon random perturbation of the cost matrix,
  with high probability, we show that all approximate second-order stationary points
  are approximate global optima for the penalty formulation of appropriately rank-constrained
  SDPs, as long as the number of constraints scales sub-quadratically with the desired
  rank. Our result is based on a simple penalty function formulation of the rank-constrained
  SDP along with a smoothed analysis to avoid worst-case cost matrices. We particularize
  our results to two applications, namely, Max-Cut and matrix completion.
