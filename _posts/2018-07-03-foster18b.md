title: 'Online Learning: Sufficient Statistics and the Burkholder Method'
abstract: 'We uncover a fairly general principle in online learning: If a regret inequality
  can be (approximately) expressed as a function of certain "sufficient statistics"
  for the data sequence, then there exists a special Burkholder function that 1) can
  be used algorithmically to achieve the regret bound and 2) only depends on these
  sufficient statistics, not the entire data sequence,  so that the online strategy
  is only required to keep the sufficient statistics in memory. This characterization
  is achieved by bringing the full power of the Burkholder Method—originally developed
  for certifying probabilistic martingale inequalities—to bear on the online learning
  setting. To demonstrate the scope and effectiveness of the Burkholder method, we
  develop a novel online strategy for matrix prediction that attains a regret bound
  corresponding to the variance term in matrix concentration inequalities. We also
  present a linear-time/space prediction strategy for parameter-free supervised learning
  with linear classes and general smooth norms.'
