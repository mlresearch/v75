title: A Faster Approximation Algorithm for the Gibbs Partition Function
abstract: " We consider the problem of estimating the partition function $Z(β)=\\sum_x
  \\exp(-βH(x))$ of a Gibbs distribution with a Hamilton $H(⋅)$, or more precisely
  the logarithm of the ratio $q=\\ln Z(0)/Z(β)$. It has been recently shown how to
  approximate $q$ with high probability assuming the existence of an oracle that produces
  samples from the Gibbs distribution for a given parameter value in $[0,β]$. The
  current best known approach due to Huber (2015) uses $O(q\\ln n⋅[\\ln q + \\ln \\ln
  n+\\varepsilon^-2])$  oracle calls on average where $\\varepsilon$ is the desired
  accuracy of approximation and $H(⋅)$ is assumed to lie in ${0}∪[1,n]$. We improve
  the complexity to $O(q\\ln n⋅\\varepsilon^-2)$ oracle calls. We also show that the
  same complexity can be achieved if exact oracles are replaced with approximate sampling
  oracles that are within $O(\\frac\\varepsilon^2q\\ln n)$ variation distance from
  exact oracles. Finally, we prove a lower bound of $Ω(q⋅\\varepsilon^-2)$ oracle
  calls under a natural model of computation. "
