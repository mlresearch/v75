title: Learning Patterns for Detection with Multiscale Scan Statistics
abstract: This paper addresses detecting anomalous patterns in images, time-series,
  and tensor data when the location and scale of the pattern and the pattern itself
  is unknown a priori. The multiscale scan statistic convolves the proposed pattern
  with the image at various scales and returns the maximum of the resulting tensor.
  Scale corrected multiscale scan statistics apply different standardizations at each
  scale, and the limiting distribution under the null hypothesis—that the data is
  only noise—is known for smooth patterns.  We consider the problem of simultaneously
  learning and detecting the anomalous pattern from a dictionary of smooth patterns
  and a database of many tensors. To this end, we show that the multiscale scan statistic
  is a subexponential random variable, and prove a chaining lemma for standardized
  suprema, which may be of independent interest. Then by averaging the statistics
  over the database of tensors we can learn the pattern and obtain Bernstein-type
  error bounds. We will also provide a construction of an $ε$-net of the location
  and scale parameters, providing a computationally tractable approximation with similar
  error bounds.
