title: Convex Optimization with Unbounded Nonconvex Oracles using Simulated Annealing
abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a convex objective function $F$ when
  one can only evaluate its noisy approximation $\hatF$. Unless one assumes some structure
  on the noise, $\hatF$ may be an arbitrary nonconvex function, making the task of
  minimizing $F$ intractable. To overcome this, prior work has often focused on the
  case when $F(x)-\hatF(x)$ is uniformly-bounded. In this paper we study the more
  general case when the noise has magnitude $αF(x) + β$ for some $α, β> 0$, and present
  a polynomial time algorithm that finds an approximate minimizer of $F$ for this
  noise model. Previously, Markov chains, such as the stochastic gradient Langevin
  dynamics, have been used to arrive at approximate solutions to these optimization
  problems. However, for the noise model considered in this paper, no single temperature
  allows such a Markov chain to both mix quickly and concentrate near the global minimizer.
  We bypass this by combining “simulated annealing" with the stochastic gradient Langevin
  dynamics, and gradually decreasing the temperature of the chain in order to approach
  the global minimizer. As a corollary one can approximately minimize a nonconvex
  function that is close to a convex function; however, the closeness can deteriorate
  as one moves away from the optimum.
