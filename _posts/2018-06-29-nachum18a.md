title: A Direct Sum Result for the Information Complexity of Learning
abstract: " How many bits of information are required to PAC learn a class of hypotheses
  of VC dimension $d$? The mathematical setting we follow is that of Bassily et al.,
  where the value of interest is the mutual information $\\mathrm{I}(S;A(S))$ between
  the input sample $S$ and the hypothesis outputted by the learning algorithm $A$.
  We introduce a class of functions of VC dimension $d$ over the domain $\\mathcal{X}$
  with information complexity at least $Î©\\left(d\\log \\log \\frac{|\\mathcal{X}|}{d}\\right)$
  bits for any consistent and proper algorithm (deterministic or random). Bassily
  et al. proved a similar (but quantitatively weaker) result for the case $d=1$. The
  above result is in fact a special case of a more general phenomenon we explore.
  We define the notion of {\\em information complexity} of a given class of functions
  $\\cH$. Intuitively, it is the minimum amount of information that an algorithm for
  $\\mathcal{X}$ must retain about its input to ensure consistency and properness.
  We prove a direct sum result for information complexity in this context; roughly
  speaking, the information complexity sums when combining several classes. "
