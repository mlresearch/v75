title: Subpolynomial trace reconstruction for random strings \\{and} arbitrary deletion
  probability
abstract: The deletion-insertion channel takes as input a bit string ${\bf x}∈\{0,1\}^{n}$,
  and outputs a string where bits have been deleted and inserted independently at
  random. The trace reconstruction problem is to recover $\bf x$ from many independent
  outputs (called “traces”) of the deletion-insertion channel applied to $\bf x$.
  We show that if $\bf x$ is chosen uniformly at random, then $\exp(O(\log^{1/3} n))$
  traces suffice to reconstruct $\bf x$ with high probability. For the deletion channel
  with deletion probability $q<1/2$ the earlier upper bound was $\exp(O(\log^{1/2}
  n))$. The case of $q≥1/2$ or the case where insertions are allowed has not been
  previously analysed, and therefore the earlier upper bound was as for worst-case
  strings, i.e., $\exp(O( n^{1/3}))$. A key ingredient in our proof is a delicate
  two-step alignment procedure where we estimate the location in each trace corresponding
  to a given bit of $\bf x$. The alignment is done by viewing the strings as random
  walks, and comparing the increments in the walk associated with the input string
  and the trace, respectively.
