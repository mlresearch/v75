title: Detection limits in the high-dimensional spiked rectangular model
abstract: 'We study the problem of detecting the presence of a single unknown spike
  in a rectangular data matrix, in a high-dimensional regime where the spike has fixed
  strength and the aspect ratio of the matrix converges to a finite limit. This setup
  includes Johnstone’s spiked covariance model. We analyze the likelihood ratio of
  the spiked model against an “all noise" null model of reference, and show it has
  asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations in a region below—but in general not up to—the
  so-called BBP threshold from random matrix theory. Our result parallels earlier
  findings of Onatski et al. (2013) and Johnstone-Onatski (2015) for spherical spikes.
  We present a probabilistic approach capable of treating generic product priors.
  In particular, sparsity in the spike is allowed. Our approach operates through the
  principle of the cavity method from spin-glass theory.  The question of the maximal
  parameter region where asymptotic normality is expected to hold is left open. This
  region, not necessarily given by BBP, is shaped by the prior in a non-trivial way.
  We conjecture that this is the entire paramagnetic phase of an associated spin-glass
  model, and is defined by the vanishing of the replica-symmetric solution of Lesieur
  et al. (2015). '
