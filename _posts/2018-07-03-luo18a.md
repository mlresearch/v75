title: Efficient Contextual Bandits in Non-stationary Worlds
abstract: Most contextual bandit algorithms minimize regret against the best fixed
  policy, a questionable benchmark for non-stationary environments that are ubiquitous
  in applications.  In this work, we develop several efficient contextual bandit algorithms
  for non-stationary environments by equipping existing methods for i.i.d. problems
  with sophisticated statistical tests so as to dynamically adapt to a change in distribution.   We
  analyze various standard notions of regret suited to non-stationary environments
  for these algorithms, including interval regret, switching regret, and dynamic regret.
  When competing with the best policy at each time, one of our algorithms achieves
  regret $\mathcalO(\sqrtST)$ if there are $T$ rounds with $S$ stationary periods,
  or more generally $\mathcalO(∆^1/3T^2/3)$ where $∆$ is some non-stationarity measure.
  These results almost match the optimal guarantees achieved by an inefficient baseline
  that is a variant of the classic Exp4 algorithm. The dynamic regret result is also
  the first one for efficient and fully adversarial contextual bandit. Furthermore,
  while the results above require tuning a parameter based on the unknown quantity
  $S$ or $∆$, we also develop a parameter free algorithm achieving regret $\min{S^1/4T^3/4,
  ∆^1/5T^4/5}$. This improves and generalizes the best existing result $∆^0.18T^0.82$
  by Karnin and Anava (2016) which only holds for the two-armed bandit problem.
