title: Counting Motifs with Graph Sampling
abstract: 'Applied researchers often construct a network from data that has been collected
  from a random sample of nodes, with the goal to infer properties of the parent network
  from the sampled version. Two of the most widely used sampling schemes are \emph{subgraph
  sampling}, where we sample each vertex independently with probability $p$ and observe
  the subgraph induced by the sampled vertices, and \emph{neighborhood sampling},
  where we additionally observe the edges between the sampled vertices and their neighbors.
  In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the number of motifs as induced
  subgraphs under both models from a statistical perspective. We show that: for parent
  graph $G$ with maximal degree $d$, for any connected motif $h$ on $k$ vertices,
  to estimate the number of copies of $h$ in $G$, denoted by $s=\s(h,G)$,  with a
  multiplicative error of $ε$,  \begin{itemize} \item For subgraph sampling, the optimal
  sampling ratio $p$ is $\Theta_{k}(\max\{ \ppth{sε^2}^{-\frac{1}{k}}, ;  \frac{d^{k-1}}{sε^{2}}
  \})$, which only depends on the size of the motif but \emph{not} its actual topology.
  Furthermore, we show that Horvitz-Thompson type estimators are universally optimal
  for any connected motifs. \item For neighborhood sampling, we propose a family of
  estimators, encompassing and outperforming the Horvitz-Thompson estimator and achieving
  the sampling ratio $O_{k}(\min\{ (\frac{d}{sε^2})^{\frac{1}{k-1}}, ; \sqrt{\frac{d^{k-2}}{sε^2}}\})$,
  which again only depends on the size of $h$. This is shown to be optimal for all
  motifs with at most $4$  vertices and cliques of all sizes.  \end{itemize} The matching
  minimax lower bounds are established using certain algebraic properties of subgraph
  counts. These results allow us to quantify how much more informative neighborhood
  sampling is than subgraph sampling, as empirically verified by experiments on synthetic
  and real-world data. We also address the issue of adaptation to the unknown maximum
  degree, and study specific problems for parent graphs with additional structures,
  e.g., trees or planar graphs.'
