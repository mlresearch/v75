title: Fitting a Putative Manifold to Noisy Data
abstract: In the present work,  we give a solution to the following  question from
  manifold learning.  Suppose data belonging to a high dimensional Euclidean space
  is drawn independently, identically distributed  from a measure supported on a low
  dimensional twice  differentiable embedded manifold $M$, and corrupted by a small
  amount of  gaussian noise. How can we produce a manifold $Mâ€™$ whose Hausdorff distance
  to $M$ is small and whose reach is not much smaller than the reach of $M$?
