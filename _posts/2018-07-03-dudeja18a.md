title: Learning Single-Index Models in Gaussian Space
abstract: We consider regression problems where the response is a smooth but non-linear
  function of a $k$-dimensional projection of $p$ normally-distributed covariates,
  contaminated with additive Gaussian noise. The goal is to recover the range of the
  $k$-dimensional projection, i.e., the index space. This model is called the multi-index
  model, and the $k=1$ case is called the single-index model. For the single-index
  model, we characterize the population landscape of a natural semi-parametric maximum
  likelihood objective in terms of the link function and prove that it has no spurious
  local minima. We also propose and analyze an efficient iterative procedure that
  recovers the index space up to error $ε$ using a sample size $\tildeO(p^O(R^2/μ)
  + p/ε^2)$, where $R$ and $μ$, respectively, parameterize the smoothness of the link
  function and the signal strength. When a multi-index model is incorrectly specified
  as a single-index model, we prove that essentially the same procedure, with sample
  size $\tildeO(p^O(kR^2/μ) + p/ε^2)$, returns a vector that is $ε$-close to being
  completely in the index space.
