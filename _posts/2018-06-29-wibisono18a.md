title: 'Sampling as optimization in the space of measures: The Langevin dynamics as
  a composite optimization problem'
abstract: We study sampling as optimization in the space of measures. We focus on
  gradient flow-based optimization with the Langevin dynamics as a case study. We
  investigate the source of the bias of the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) in
  discrete time, and consider how to remove or reduce the bias. We point out the difficulty
  is that the heat flow is exactly solvable, but neither its forward nor backward
  method is implementable in general, except for Gaussian data. We propose the symmetrized
  Langevin algorithm (SLA), which should have a smaller bias than ULA, at the price
  of implementing a proximal gradient step in space. We show SLA is in fact consistent
  for Gaussian target measure, whereas ULA is not. We also illustrate various algorithms
  explicitly for Gaussian target measure with Gaussian data, including gradient descent,
  proximal gradient, and Forward-Backward, and show they are all consistent.
