title: Non-Convex Matrix Completion Against a Semi-Random Adversary
abstract: " Matrix completion is a well-studied problem with many machine learning
  applications. In practice, the problem is often solved by non-convex optimization
  algorithms. However, the current theoretical analysis for non-convex algorithms
  relies crucially on the assumption that each entry of the matrix is observed with
  exactly the same probability $p$, which is not realistic in practice. In this paper,
  we investigate a more realistic semi-random model, where the probability of observing
  each entry is {\\em at least} $p$.  Even with this mild semi-random perturbation,
  we can construct counter-examples where existing non-convex algorithms get stuck
  in bad local optima. In light of the negative results, we propose a pre-processing
  step that tries to re-weight the semi-random input, so that it becomes “similar”
  to a random input. We give a nearly-linear time algorithm for this problem, and
  show that after our pre-processing, all the local minima of the non-convex objective
  can be used to approximately recover the underlying ground-truth matrix. "
