title: Optimal Single Sample Tests for Structured versus Unstructured Network Data
abstract: " We study the problem of testing, using only a single sample, between mean
  field distribu- tions (like Curie-Weiss, Erdős-Rényi) and structured Gibbs distributions
  (like Ising model on sparse graphs and Exponential Random Graphs). Our goal is to
  test without know- ing the parameter values of the underlying models: only the structure
  of dependencies is known. We develop a new approach that applies to both the Ising
  and Exponential Random Graph settings based on a general and natural statistical
  test. The test can dis- tinguish the hypotheses with high probability above a certain
  threshold in the (inverse) temperature parameter, and is optimal in that below the
  threshold no test can distinguish the hypotheses. The thresholds do not correspond
  to the presence of long-range order in the models. By aggregating information at
  a global scale, our test works even at very high temperatures. The proofs are based
  on distributional approximation and sharp concentration of quadratic forms, when
  restricted to Hamming spheres. The restriction to Hamming spheres is necessary,
  since otherwise any scalar statistic is useless without explicit knowledge of the
  temperature parameter. At the same time, this restriction changes the behavior of
  the functions under consideration, making it hard to directly apply standard methods
  (i.e., Stein’s method) for concentration of weakly dependent variables. Instead,
  we carry out an additional tensorization argument using a Markov chain that respects
  the symmetry of the Hamming sphere. "
