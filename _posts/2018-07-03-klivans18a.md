title: Efficient Algorithms for Outlier-Robust Regression
abstract: " We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for performing linear or polynomial
  regression resilient to adversarial corruptions in both examples and labels. Given
  a sufficiently large (polynomial-size) training set drawn i.i.d. from distribution
  $\\mathcalD$ and subsequently corrupted on some fraction of points, our algorithm
  outputs a linear function whose squared error is close to the squared error of the
  best-fitting linear function with respect to $\\mathcalD$, assuming that the marginal
  distribution of $\\mathcalD$ over the input space is \\emphcertifiably hypercontractive.
  This natural property is satisfied by many well-studied distributions such as Gaussian,
  strongly log-concave distributions and, uniform distribution on the hypercube among
  others.  We also give a simple statistical lower bound showing that some distributional
  assumption is necessary to succeed in this setting.  These results are the first
  of their kind and were not known to be even information-theoretically possible prior
  to our work.   Our approach is based on the sum-of-squares (SoS) method and is inspired
  by the recent applications of the method for parameter recovery problems in unsupervised
  learning. Our algorithm can be seen as a natural convex relaxation of the following
  conceptually simple non-convex optimization problem: find a linear function and
  a large subset of the input corrupted sample such that the least squares loss of
  the function over the subset is minimized over all possible large subsets. "
