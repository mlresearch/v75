title: 'Open problem: Improper learning of mixtures of {G}aussians'
abstract: We ask whether there exists an efficient unsupervised learning algorithm
  for mixture of Gaussians in the over-complete case (number of mixtures is larger
  than the dimension). The notion of learning is taken to be worst-case compression-based,
  to allow for improper learning.
