title: Information Directed Sampling and Bandits with Heteroscedastic Noise
abstract: In the stochastic bandit problem, the goal is to maximize an unknown function
  via a sequence of noisy evaluations. Typically, the observation noise is assumed
  to be independent of the evaluation point and to satisfy a tail bound uniformly
  on the domain; a restrictive assumption for many applications. In this work, we
  consider bandits with heteroscedastic noise, where we explicitly allow the noise
  distribution to depend on the evaluation point. We show that this leads to new trade-offs
  for information and regret, which are not taken into account by existing approaches
  like upper confidence bound algorithms (UCB) or Thompson Sampling. To address these
  shortcomings, we introduce a frequentist regret analysis framework, that is similar
  to the Bayesian framework of Russo and Van Roy (2014), and we prove a new high-probability
  regret bound for general, possibly randomized policies, which depends on a quantity
  we refer to as regret-information ratio. From this bound, we define a frequentist
  version of Information Directed Sampling (IDS) to minimize the regret-information
  ratio over all possible action sampling distributions. This further relies on concentration
  inequalities for online least squares regression in separable Hilbert spaces, which
  we generalize to the case of heteroscedastic noise. We then formulate several variants
  of IDS for linear and reproducing kernel Hilbert space response functions, yielding
  novel algorithms for Bayesian optimization. We also prove frequentist regret bounds,
  which in the homoscedastic case recover known bounds for UCB, but can be much better
  when the noise is heteroscedastic. Empirically, we demonstrate in a linear setting
  with heteroscedastic noise, that some of our methods can outperform UCB and Thompson
  Sampling, while staying competitive when the noise is homoscedastic.
