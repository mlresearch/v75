title: Marginal Singularity, and the Benefits of Labels in Covariate-Shift
abstract: 'We present new minimax results that concisely capture the relative benefits
  of source and target labeled data, under {covariate-shift}. Namely, we show that,
  in general classification settings, the benefits of target labels are controlled
  by a \emph{transfer-exponent} $\gamma$ that encodes how \emph{singular} $Q$ is locally
  w.r.t. $P$, and interestingly allows situations where transfer did not seem possible
  under previous insights. In fact, our new minimax analysis – in terms of $\gamma$
  – reveals a \emph{continuum of regimes} ranging from situations where target labels
  have little benefit, to regimes where target labels dramatically improve classification.  We
  then show that a recently proposed semi-supervised procedure can be extended to
  adapt to unknown $\gamma$, and therefore requests target labels only when beneficial,
  while achieving nearly minimax transfer rates. '
