title: "{L}angevin {M}onte {C}arlo and {JKO} splitting"
abstract: Algorithms based on discretizing Langevin diffusion are popular tools for
  sampling from high-dimensional distributions. We develop novel connections between
  such Monte Carlo algorithms, the theory of Wasserstein gradient flow, and the operator
  splitting approach to solving PDEs. In particular, we show that a proximal version
  of the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm corresponds to a scheme that alternates between
  solving the gradient flows of two specific functionals on the space of probability
  measures. Using this perspective, we derive some new non-asymptotic results on the
  convergence properties of this algorithm.
