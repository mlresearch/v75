title: Privacy-preserving Prediction
abstract: Ensuring differential privacy of models learned from sensitive user data
  is an important goal that has been studied extensively in recent years. It is now
  known that for some basic learning problems, especially those involving high-dimensional
  data, producing an accurate private model requires much more data than learning
  without privacy. At the same time, in many applications it is not necessary to expose
  the model itself. Instead users may be allowed to query the prediction model on
  their inputs only through an appropriate interface. Here we formulate the problem
  of ensuring privacy of individual predictions and investigate the overheads required
  to achieve it in several standard models of classification and regression. We first
  describe a simple baseline approach based on training several models on disjoint
  subsets of data and using standard private aggregation techniques to predict. We
  show that this approach has nearly optimal sample complexity for (realizable) PAC
  learning of any class of Boolean functions. At the same time, without strong assumptions
  on the data distribution, the aggregation step introduces a substantial overhead.
  We demonstrate that this overhead can be avoided for the well-studied class of thresholds
  on a line and for a number of standard settings of convex regression. The analysis
  of our algorithm for learning thresholds relies crucially on strong generalization
  guarantees that we establish for all differentially private prediction algorithms.
