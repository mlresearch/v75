title: More Adaptive Algorithms for Adversarial Bandits
abstract: 'We develop a novel and generic algorithm for the adversarial multi-armed
  bandit problem (or more generally the combinatorial semi-bandit problem). When instantiated
  differently, our algorithm achieves various new data-dependent regret bounds improving
  previous work. Examples include: 1) a regret bound depending on the variance of
  only the best arm; 2) a regret bound depending on the first-order path-length of
  only the best arm; 3) a regret bound depending on the sum of the first-order path-lengths
  of all arms as well as an important negative term, which together lead to faster
  convergence rates for some normal form games with partial feedback; 4) a regret
  bound that simultaneously implies small regret when the best arm has small loss
  {\it and} logarithmic regret when there exists an arm whose expected loss is always
  smaller than those of other arms by a fixed gap (e.g. the classic i.i.d. setting).
  In some cases, such as the last two results, our algorithm is completely parameter-free.
  The main idea of our algorithm is to apply the optimism and adaptivity techniques
  to the well-known Online Mirror Descent framework with a special log-barrier regularizer.
  The challenges are to come up with appropriate optimistic predictions and correction
  terms in this framework. Some of our results also crucially rely on using a sophisticated
  increasing learning rate schedule.'
