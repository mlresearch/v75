title: Accelerated Gradient Descent Escapes Saddle Points Faster than Gradient Descent
abstract: 'Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent (AGD), an instance of the general
  family of “momentum methods,” provably achieves faster convergence rate than gradient
  descent (GD) in the convex setting. While these methods are widely used in modern
  \emph{nonconvex} applications, including training of deep neural networks, whether
  they are provably superior to GD in the nonconvex setting remains open. This paper
  studies a simple variant of Nesterov’s AGD, and shows that it escapes saddle points
  and finds a second-order stationary point in $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{7/4})$ iterations,
  matching the best known convergence rate, which is faster than the $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{2})$
  iterations required by GD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct
  acceleration (single-loop) algorithm that is provably faster than GD in general
  nonconvex setting—all previous nonconvex accelerated algorithms rely on more complex
  mechanisms such as nested loops and proximal terms. Our analysis is based on two
  key ideas: (1) the use of a simple Hamiltonian function, inspired by a continuous-time
  perspective, which AGD monotonically decreases on each step even for nonconvex functions,
  and (2) a novel framework called \emph{improve or localize}, which is useful for
  tracking the long-term behavior of gradient-based optimization algorithms. We believe
  that these techniques may deepen our understanding of both acceleration algorithms
  and nonconvex optimization.'
