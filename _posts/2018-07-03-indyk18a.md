title: Approximate Nearest Neighbors in Limited  Space
abstract: 'We consider the $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate nearest neighbor search problem:
  given a set $X$ of $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space, build a data structure
  that, given any query point  $y$,  finds a point $x \in X$ whose distance to $y$
  is at most $(1+\epsilon) \min_{x \in X} \|x-y\|$ for an accuracy parameter $\epsilon
  \in (0,1)$.  Our main result is a data structure that occupies only $O(\epsilon^{-2}
  n \log(n) \log(1/\epsilon))$ bits of space, assuming all point coordinates are integers
  in the range  $\{-n^{O(1)} \ldots n^{O(1)}\}$, i.e., the coordinates have $O(\log
  n)$ bits of precision. This improves over the best previously known space bound
  of         $O(\epsilon^{-2} n \log(n)^2)$, obtained via the randomized dimensionality
  reduction method of Johnson and Lindenstrauss (1984).  We also consider the more
  general problem of estimating all distances from a collection of query points to
  all data points $X$, and provide almost tight upper and lower bounds for the space
  complexity of this problem. '
