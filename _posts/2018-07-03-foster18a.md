title: 'Logistic Regression: The Importance of Being Improper'
abstract: 'Learning linear predictors with the logistic loss—both in stochastic and
  online settings—is a fundamental task in machine learning and statistics, with direct
  connections to classification and boosting. Existing “fast rates” for this setting
  exhibit exponential dependence on the predictor norm, and Hazan et al. (2014) showed
  that this is unfortunately unimprovable. Starting with the simple observation that
  the logistic loss is $1$-mixable, we design a new efficient improper learning algorithm
  for online logistic regression that circumvents the aforementioned lower bound with
  a regret bound exhibiting a doubly-exponential improvement in dependence on the
  predictor norm. This provides a positive resolution to a variant of the COLT 2012
  open problem of McMahan and Streeter (2012) when improper learning is allowed. This
  improvement is obtained both in the online setting and, with some extra work, in
  the batch statistical setting with high probability. We also show that the improved
  dependence on predictor norm is near-optimal.  Leveraging this improved dependency
  on the predictor norm yields the following applications: (a) we give algorithms
  for online bandit multiclass learning with the logistic loss with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$
  relative mistake bound across essentially all parameter ranges, thus providing a
  solution to the COLT 2009 open problem of Abernethy and Rakhlin (2009), and (b)
  we give an adaptive algorithm for online multiclass boosting with optimal sample
  complexity, thus partially resolving an open problem of Beygelzimer et al. (2015)
  and Jung et al. (2017). Finally, we give information-theoretic bounds on the optimal
  rates for improper logistic regression with general function classes, thereby characterizing
  the extent to which our improvement for linear classes extends to other parametric
  and even nonparametric settings.'
