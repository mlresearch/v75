title: Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent for Least Squares Regression
abstract: There is widespread sentiment that fast gradient methods (e.g. Nesterovâ€™s
  acceleration, conjugate gradient, heavy ball) are not effective for the purposes
  of stochastic optimization due to their instability and error accumulation. Numerous
  works have attempted to quantify these instabilities in the face of either statistical
  or non-statistical. This work considers these issues for the special case of stochastic
  approximation for the least squares regression problem, and our main result refutes
  this conventional wisdom by showing that acceleration can be made robust to statistical
  errors.  In particular, this work introduces an accelerated stochastic gradient
  method that provably achieves the minimax optimal statistical risk faster than stochastic
  gradient descent.  Critical to the analysis is a sharp characterization of accelerated
  stochastic gradient descent as a stochastic process. We hope this characterization
  gives insights towards the broader question of designing simple and effective accelerated
  stochastic methods for more general convex and non-convex optimization problems.
