title: Hardness of Learning Noisy Halfspaces using Polynomial Thresholds
abstract: 'We prove the hardness of weakly learning halfspaces in the presence of
  adversarial noise using polynomial threshold functions (PTFs). In particular, we
  prove that for any constants $d âˆˆ\mathbb{Z}^+$ and $\eps > 0$, it is NP-hard to
  decide: given a set of $\{-1,1\}$-labeled points in $\mathbb{R}^n$  whether (YES
  Case) there exists a halfspace that classifies $(1-\eps)$-fraction of the points
  correctly, or (NO Case) any degree-$d$ PTF classifies at most $(1/2 + \eps)$-fraction
  of the points correctly. This strengthens to all constant degrees the previous NP-hardness
  of learning using degree-$2$ PTFs shown by Diakonikolas et al. (2011). The latter
  result had remained the only progress over the works of Feldman et al. (2006) and
  Guruswami et al. (2006) ruling out weakly proper learning adversarially noisy halfspaces.'
