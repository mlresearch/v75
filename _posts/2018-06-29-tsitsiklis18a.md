title: Private Sequential Learning
abstract: We formulate a private learning model to study an intrinsic tradeoff between
  privacy and query complexity in sequential learning. Our model involves a learner
  who aims to determine a scalar value, $v^*$, by sequentially querying an external
  database and receiving binary responses. In the meantime, an adversary observes
  the learner’s queries, though not the responses, and tries to infer from them the
  value of $v^*$. The objective of the learner is to obtain an accurate estimate of
  $v^*$ using only a small number of queries, while simultaneously protecting her
  privacy by making $v^*$ provably difficult to learn for the adversary. Our main
  results provide tight upper and lower bounds on the learner’s query complexity as
  a function of desired levels of privacy and estimation accuracy. We also construct
  explicit query strategies whose complexity is optimal up to an additive constant.
