title: 'Best of both worlds: Stochastic & adversarial best-arm identification'
abstract: 'We study bandit best-arm identification with arbitrary and potentially
  adversarial rewards. A simple random uniform learner obtains the optimal rate of
  error in the adversarial scenario. However, this type of strategy is suboptimal
  when the rewards are sampled stochastically. Therefore, we ask: $\backslash$emph{\{}Can
  we design a learner that performs optimally in both the stochastic and adversarial
  problems while not being aware of the nature of the rewards?{\}} First, we show
  that designing such a learner is impossible in general. In particular, to be robust
  to adversarial rewards, we can only guarantee optimal rates of error on a subset
  of the stochastic problems. We give a lower bound that characterizes the optimal
  rate in stochastic problems if the strategy is constrained to be robust to adversarial
  rewards. Finally, we design a simple parameter-free algorithm and show that its
  probability of error matches (up to log factors) the lower bound in stochastic problems,
  and it is also robust to adversarial ones.'
