title: 'Breaking the $1/\sqrt{n}$ Barrier: Faster Rates for Permutation-based Models
  in Polynomial Time'
abstract: Many applications, including rank aggregation and crowd-labeling, can be
  modeled in terms of a bivariate isotonic matrix with unknown permutations acting
  on its rows and columns.  We consider the problem of estimating such a matrix based
  on noisy observations of a subset of its entries, and design and analyze a polynomial-time
  algorithm that improves upon the state of the art. In particular, our results imply
  that any such $n \times n$ matrix can be estimated efficiently in the normalized
  Frobenius norm at rate $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(n^{-3/4})$, thus narrowing the gap
  between $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(n^{-1})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(n^{-1/2})$,
  which were hitherto the rates of the most statistically and computationally efficient
  methods, respectively.
