title: Efficient Convex Optimization with Membership Oracles
abstract: " We consider the problem of minimizing a convex function over a convex
  set given access only to an evaluation oracle for the function and a membership
  oracle for the set. We give a simple algorithm which solves this problem with $\\tilde{O}(n^{2})$
  oracle calls and $\\tilde{O}(n^{3})$ additional arithmetic operations. Using this
  result, we obtain more efficient reductions among the five basic oracles for convex
  sets and functions defined by Gr{รถ}tschel, Lov{รก}sz, and Schrijver (1988). "
