title: Adaptivity to Smoothness in X-armed bandits
abstract: We study the stochastic continuum-armed bandit problem from the angle of
  adaptivity to \emph{unknown regularity} of the reward function $f$. We prove that
  there exists no strategy for the cumulative regret that adapts optimally to the
  \emph{smoothness} of $f$. We show however that such minimax optimal adaptive strategies
  exist if the learner is given \emph{extra-information} about $f$. Finally, we complement
  our positive results with matching lower bounds.
