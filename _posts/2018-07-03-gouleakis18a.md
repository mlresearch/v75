title: Certified Computation from Unreliable Datasets
abstract: 'A wide range of learning tasks require human input in labeling massive
  data. The collected data though are usually low quality and contain inaccuracies
  and errors. As a result, modern science and business face the problem of learning
  from unreliable data sets. In this work, we provide a generic approach that is based
  on \textit{verification} of only few records of the data set to guarantee high quality
  learning outcomes for various optimization objectives. Our method, identifies small
  sets of critical records and verifies their validity. We show that many problems
  only need $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ verifications, to ensure that the output
  of the computation is at most a factor of $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$ away from the truth.
  For any given instance, we provide an \textit{instance optimal} solution that verifies
  the minimum possible number of records to approximately certify correctness. Then
  using this instance optimal formulation of the problem we prove our main result:
  “every function that satisfies some Lipschitz continuity condition can be certified
  with a small number of verifications”. We show that the required Lipschitz continuity
  condition is satisfied even by some NP-complete problems, which illustrates the
  generality and importance of this theorem. In case this certification step fails,
  an invalid record will be identified. Removing these records and repeating until
  success, guarantees that the result will be accurate and will depend only on the
  verified records. Surprisingly, as we show, for several computation tasks more efficient
  methods are possible. These methods always guarantee that the produced result is
  not affected by the invalid records, since any invalid record that affects the output
  will be detected and verified.'
