title: Optimal Errors and Phase Transitions in High-Dimensional Generalized Linear
  Models
abstract: Generalized linear models (GLMs) arise in high-dimensional machine learning,
  statistics, communications and signal processing. % In this paper we analyze GLMs
  when the data matrix is random, as relevant in problems such as compressed sensing,
  error-correcting codes or benchmarks models in neural networks. % We evaluate the
  mutual information (or “free entropy”) from which we deduce the Bayes-optimal inference
  and generalization errors.  Our analysis applies to the high-dimensional limit where
  both the number of samples and dimensions are large and their ratio is fixed. %
  Non-rigorous predictions for the optimal inference and generalization errors existed
  for special cases of GLMs, e.g. for the perceptron in the field of statistical physics
  based on the so-called replica method. Our present paper rigorously establishes
  those decades old conjectures and brings forward their algorithmic interpretation
  in terms of performance of the generalized approximate message-passing algorithm.
  % Furthermore, we tightly characterize, for many learning problems, regions of parameters
  for which this algorithm achieves the optimal performance, and locate the associated
  sharp phase transitions separating learnable and non-learnable regions.
