title: Exact and Robust Conformal Inference Methods for Predictive Machine Learning
  with Dependent Data
abstract: We extend conformal inference to general settings that allow for time series
  data. Our proposal is developed as a randomization method and  accounts for potential
  serial dependence by including  block structures in the permutation scheme. As a
  result, the proposed method retains the exact, model-free validity when the data
  are i.i.d. or more generally exchangeable, similar to usual conformal inference
  methods.  When exchangeability fails, as is the case for common time series data,
  the proposed approach is approximately valid under weak assumptions on the conformity
  score.
