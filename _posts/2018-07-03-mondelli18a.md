title: Fundamental Limits of Weak Recovery with Applications to Phase Retrieval
abstract: 'In phase retrieval we want to recover an unknown signal $\boldsymbol x∈\mathbb
  C^d$ from $n$ quadratic measurements of the form  $y_i = |⟨\boldsymbol a_i,\boldsymbol
  x⟩|^2+w_i$ where $\boldsymbol a_i∈\mathbb C^d$ are known sensing vectors and  $w_i$
  is measurement noise. We ask the following \emphweak recovery question: what is
  the minimum number of measurements $n$ needed to produce an estimator $\hat\boldsymbol
  x(\boldsymbol y)$ that is positively correlated with  the signal $\boldsymbol x$?
  We consider the case of Gaussian  vectors $\boldsymbol a_i$. We prove that – in
  the high-dimensional limit – a sharp phase transition takes place, and we locate
  the threshold in the regime of vanishingly small noise. For $n\le d-o(d)$ no estimator
  can do significantly better than random and achieve a strictly positive correlation.
  For $n\ge d+o(d)$ a simple spectral estimator achieves a positive correlation.  Surprisingly,
  numerical simulations with the same spectral estimator  demonstrate promising performance
  with realistic sensing matrices.  Spectral methods are used to initialize non-convex
  optimization algorithms in phase retrieval, and our approach can boost the performance
  in this setting as well. Our impossibility result is based on classical information-theory
  arguments. The spectral algorithm computes the leading eigenvector of a weighted
  empirical covariance matrix. We obtain a sharp characterization of the spectral
  properties of this random matrix  using tools from free probability and generalizing
  a recent result by Lu and Li.  Both the upper and lower bound generalize beyond
  phase retrieval to measurements $y_i$ produced according to a generalized linear
  model.  As a byproduct of our analysis, we compare the threshold of the proposed
  spectral method with that of a message passing algorithm.  '
