title: Unleashing Linear Optimizers for Group-Fair Learning and Optimization
abstract: Most systems and learning algorithms optimize average performance or average
  loss â€“ one reason being computational complexity. However, many objectives of practical
  interest are more complex than simply average loss. This arises, for example, when
  balancing performance or loss with fairness across people. We prove that, from a
  computational perspective, optimizing arbitrary objectives that take into account
  performance over a small number of groups is not significantly harder to optimize
  than average performance. Our main result is a polynomial-time reduction that uses
  a linear optimizer to optimize an arbitrary (Lipschitz continuous) function of performance
  over a (constant) number of possibly-overlapping groups. This includes fairness
  objectives over small numbers of groups, and we further point out that other existing
  notions of fairness such as individual fairness can be cast as convex optimization
  and hence more standard convex techniques can be used. Beyond learning, our approach
  applies to multi-objective optimization, more generally.
