title: Hidden Integrality of SDP Relaxations for Sub-Gaussian Mixture Models
abstract: 'We consider the problem of finding discrete clustering structures under
  Sub-Gaussian Mixture Models. We establish a hidden integrality property of a semidefinite
  programming (SDP) relaxation for this problem: while the optimal solutions to the
  SDP are not integer-valued in general, their estimation errors can be upper bounded
  by the error of an idealized integer program. The error of the integer program,
  and hence that of the SDP, are further shown to decay exponentially in the signal-to-noise
  ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exponentially decaying error
  bound for convex relaxations of mixture models. A special case of this result shows
  that in certain regimes the SDP solutions are in fact integral and exact, improving
  on existing exact recovery results for convex relaxations. More generally, our result
  establishes sufficient conditions for the SDP to correctly recover the cluster memberships
  of at least $(1-δ)$ fraction of the points for any $δ∈(0,1)$. Error bounds for estimating
  cluster centers can also be derived directly from our results.'
