title: An Analysis of the t-SNE Algorithm for Data Visualization
abstract: A first line of attack in exploratory data analysis is \emph{data visualization},
  i.e., generating a 2-dimensional representation of data that makes \emph{clusters}
  of similar points visually identifiable. Standard Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimensionality
  reduction does not produce data visualizations. The \emph{t-SNE} heuristic of van
  der Maaten and Hinton, which is based on non-convex optimization, has become the
  \emph{de facto} standard for visualization in a wide range of applications. This
  work gives a formal framework for the problem of data visualization – finding a
  2-dimensional embedding of clusterable data that correctly separates individual
  clusters to make them visually identifiable. We then give a rigorous analysis of
  the performance of t-SNE under a natural, deterministic condition on the “ground-truth”
  clusters (similar to conditions assumed in earlier analyses of clustering) in the
  underlying data. These are the first provable guarantees on t-SNE for constructing
  good data visualizations.  We show that our deterministic condition is satisfied
  by considerably general probabilistic generative models for clusterable data such
  as mixtures of well-separated log-concave distributions. Finally, we give theoretical
  evidence that t-SNE provably succeeds in \emph{partially} recovering cluster structure
  even when the above deterministic condition is not met.
