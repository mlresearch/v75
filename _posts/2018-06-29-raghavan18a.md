title: The Externalities of Exploration and How Data Diversity Helps Exploitation
abstract: Online learning algorithms, widely used to power search and content optimization
  on the web, must balance exploration and exploitation, potentially sacrificing the
  experience of current users in order to gain information that will lead to better
  decisions in the future.  Recently, concerns have been raised about whether the
  process of exploration could be viewed as unfair, placing too much burden on certain
  individuals or groups.  Motivated by these concerns, we initiate the study of the
  externalities of exploration—the undesirable side effects that the presence of one
  party may impose on another—under the linear contextual bandits model.  We introduce
  the notion of a group externality, measuring the extent to which the presence of
  one population of users (the majority) impacts the rewards of another (the minority).
  We show that this impact can, in some cases, be negative, and that, in a certain
  sense, no algorithm can avoid it.  We then move on to study externalities at the
  individual level, interpreting the act of exploration as an externality imposed
  on the current user of a system by future users. This drives us to ask under what
  conditions inherent diversity in the data makes explicit exploration unnecessary.  We
  build on a recent line of work on the smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm
  that always chooses the action that currently looks optimal. We improve on prior
  results to show that a greedy approach almost matches the best possible Bayesian
  regret rate of any other algorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity
  conditions hold, and that this regret is at most $\tilde{O}(T^{1/3})$. Returning
  to group-level effects, we show that under the same conditions, negative group externalities
  essentially vanish if one runs the greedy algorithm. Together, our results uncover
  a sharp contrast between the high externalities that exist in the worst case, and
  the ability to remove all externalities if the data is sufficiently diverse.
