title: 'Generalization Bounds of SGLD for Non-convex Learning: Two Theoretical Viewpoints'
abstract: We study the generalization errors of \emph{non-convex} regularized ERM
  procedures using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Two theories are
  proposed with non-asymptotic discrete-time analysis, using stability and PAC-Bayesian
  theory respectively. The stability-based theory obtains a bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{n}L\sqrt{βT_N}\right)$,
  where $L$ is Lipschitz parameter, $β$ is inverse temperature, and $T_N$ is the sum
  of step sizes. For PAC-Bayesian theory, though the bound has a slower $O(1/\sqrt{n})$
  rate, the contribution of each step decays exponentially through time, and the uniform
  Lipschitz constant is also replaced by actual norms of gradients along the optimization
  trajectory. Our bounds have reasonable dependence on aggregated step sizes, and
  do not explicitly depend on dimensions, norms or other capacity measures of the
  parameter. The bounds characterize how the noises in the algorithm itself controls
  the statistical learning behavior in non-convex problems, without uniform convergence
  in the hypothesis space, which sheds light on the effect of training algorithms
  on the generalization error for deep neural networks.
