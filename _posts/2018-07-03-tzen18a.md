title: Local Optimality and Generalization Guarantees for the Langevin Algorithm via
  Empirical Metastability
abstract: 'We study the detailed path-wise behavior of the discrete-time Langevin
  algorithm for non-convex Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) through the lens of metastability,
  adopting some techniques from Berglund and Gentz (2003). For a particular local
  optimum of the empirical risk, with an \textit{arbitrary initialization}, we show
  that, with high probability, at least one of the following two events will occur:
  (1) the Langevin trajectory ends up somewhere outside the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood
  of this particular optimum within a short \textit{recurrence time}; (2) it enters
  this $\varepsilon$-neighborhood by the recurrence time and stays there until a potentially
  exponentially long \textit{escape time}. We call this phenomenon \textit{empirical
  metastability}. This two-timescale characterization aligns nicely with the existing
  literature in the following two senses. First, the effective recurrence time (i.e.,
  number of iterations multiplied by stepsize) is dimension-independent, and resembles
  the convergence time of continuous-time deterministic Gradient Descent (GD). However
  unlike GD, the Langevin algorithm does not require strong conditions on local initialization,
  and has the possibility of eventually visiting all optima. Second, the scaling of
  the escape time is consistent with the Eyring-Kramers law, which states that the
  Langevin scheme will eventually visit all local minima, but it will take an exponentially
  long time to transit among them. We apply this path-wise concentration result in
  the context of statistical learning to examine local notions of generalization and
  optimality. '
