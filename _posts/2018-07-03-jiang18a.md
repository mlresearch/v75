title: 'Open Problem: The Dependence of Sample Complexity Lower Bounds on Planning
  Horizon'
abstract: 'In reinforcement learning (RL), problems with long planning horizons are
  perceived as very challenging. The recent advances in PAC RL, however, show that
  the sample complexity of RL does not depend on planning horizon except at a superficial
  level. How can we explain such a difference? Noting that the technical assumptions
  in these upper bounds might have hidden away the challenges of long horizons, we
  ask the question: \emph{can we prove a lower bound with a horizon dependence when
  such assumptions are removed?} We also provide a few observations on the desired
  characteristics of the lower bound construction.'
