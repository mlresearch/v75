title: The Vertex Sample Complexity of Free Energy is Polynomial
abstract: 'The free energy is a key quantity which is associated to Markov random
  fields. Classical results in statistical physics show how, given an analytic formula
  of the free energy, it is possible to compute many key quantities associated with
  Markov random fields including quantities such as magnetization and the location
  of various phase transitions.  Given a massive Markov random field on $n$ nodes,
  can a small sample from it provide a rough approximation to the free energy $\mathcal{F}_n
  = \log{Z_n}$?  Results in the graph limit literature by Borgs, Chayes, Lov{รก}sz,
  S{รณ}s, and Vesztergombi show that  for Ising models on $n$ nodes and interactions
  of strength $\Theta(1/n)$, an $\epsilon$ approximation to $\log Z_n / n$ can be
  achieved by sampling a randomly induced model on $2^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ nodes. We
  show that the sampling complexity of this problem is {\em polynomial in }$1/\epsilon$.
  We further show a polynomial dependence on $\epsilon$ cannot be avoided.  Our results
  are very general as they apply to higher order Markov random fields. For Markov
  random fields of order $r$, we obtain an algorithm that achieves $\epsilon$ approximation
  using a number of samples polynomial in $r$ and $1/\epsilon$ and running time that
  is $2^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ up to polynomial factors in $r$ and $\epsilon$. For ferromagnetic
  Ising models, the running time is polynomial in $1/\epsilon$.  Our results are intimately
  connected to recent research on the regularity lemma and property testing, where
  the interest is in finding which properties can tested within $\epsilon$ error in
  time polynomial in $1/\epsilon$. In particular, our proofs build on results of Alon,
  de la Vega, Kannan and Karpinski, who also introduced the notion of polynomial vertex
  sample complexity. Another critical ingredient of the proof is an effective bound
  by the authors of this paper relating the variational free energy and the free energy.  '
