title: Testing Symmetric Markov Chains From a Single Trajectory
abstract: 'The paper’s abstract in valid LaTeX, without non-standard macros or \cite
  commands. Classical distribution testing assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the
  distribution that is being tested. We initiate the study of Markov chain  testing,
  assuming access to a \em single trajectory of a Markov Chain. In particular, we
  observe a single trajectory $X_0,\ldots,X_t,\ldots$ of an unknown, symmetric, and
  finite state Markov Chain $\cal M$. We do not control the starting state $X_0$,
  and we cannot restart the chain. Given our single trajectory, the goal is to test
  whether  $\cal M$ is identical to a model Markov Chain $\cal M’$, or far from it
  under an appropriate notion of difference. We propose a measure of difference between
  two Markov chains, motivated by the early work of Kazakos [78],  which captures
  the scaling behavior of the total variation distance between trajectories sampled
  from the Markov chains as the length of these trajectories grows. We provide efficient
  testers and information-theoretic lower bounds for testing identity of symmetric
  Markov chains under our proposed measure of difference, which are tight up to logarithmic
  factors if the hitting times of the model chain $\cal M’$ is $\tildeO(n)$ in  the
  size of the state space $n$. '
