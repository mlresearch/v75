title: Cutting plane methods can be extended into nonconvex optimization
abstract: 'We show that it is possible to obtain an $O(ε^{-4/3})$ runtime — including
  computational cost — for finding $ε$-stationary points of nonconvex functions using
  cutting plane methods. This improves on the best known epsilon dependence achieved
  by cubic regularized Newton of $O(ε^{-3/2})$ as proved by Nesterov and Polyak (2006).
  Our techniques utilize the convex until proven guilty principle proposed by Carmon,
  Duchi, Hinder, and Sidford (2017). '
