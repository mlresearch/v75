title: Geometric Lower Bounds for Distributed Parameter Estimation under Communication
  Constraints
abstract: We consider parameter estimation in distributed networks, where each sensor
  in the network observes an independent sample from an underlying distribution and
  has $k$ bits to communicate its sample to a centralized processor which computes
  an estimate of a desired parameter. We develop lower bounds for the minimax risk
  of estimating the underlying parameter under squared $\ell_2$ loss for a large class
  of distributions. Our results show that under mild regularity conditions, the communication
  constraint reduces the effective sample size by a factor of $d$ when $k$ is small,
  where $d$ is the dimension of the estimated parameter. Furthermore, this penalty
  reduces at most exponentially with increasing $k$, which is the case for some models,
  e.g., estimating high-dimensional distributions. For other models however, we show
  that the sample size reduction is re-mediated only linearly with increasing $k$,
  e.g. when some sub-Gaussian structure is available. We apply our results to the
  distributed setting with product Bernoulli model, multinomial model, and dense/sparse
  Gaussian location models which recover or strengthen existing results. Our approach
  significantly deviates from existing approaches for developing information-theoretic
  lower bounds for communication-efficient estimation. We circumvent the need for
  strong data processing inequalities used in prior work and develop a geometric approach
  which builds on a new representation of the communication constraint. This approach
  allows us to strengthen and generalize existing results with simpler and more transparent
  proofs.
