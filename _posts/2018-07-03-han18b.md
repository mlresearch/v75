title: 'Local moment matching: A unified methodology for symmetric functional estimation
  and distribution estimation under Wasserstein distance'
abstract: We present \emphLocal Moment Matching (LMM), a unified methodology for symmetric
  functional estimation and distribution estimation under Wasserstein distance. We
  construct an efficiently computable estimator that achieves the minimax rates in
  estimating the distribution up to permutation, and show that the plug-in approach
  of our unlabeled distribution estimator is â€œuniversal" in estimating symmetric functionals
  of discrete distributions. Instead of doing best polynomial approximation explicitly
  as in existing literature of functional estimation, the plug-in approach conducts
  polynomial approximation implicitly and attains the optimal sample complexity for
  the entropy, power sum and support size functionals.
