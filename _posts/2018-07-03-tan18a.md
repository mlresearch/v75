title: 'Polynomial Time and Sample Complexity for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis:
  Spectral Methods'
abstract: The problem of Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) is about finding a
  maximal low-dimensional subspace $E$ in $\mathbbR^n$ so that data points projected
  onto $E$ follow a non-Gaussian distribution. Vempala and Xiao (2011) proposed a
  local search algorithm, and showed that it was able to estimate $E$ accurately with
  polynomial time and sample complexity, if the dimension of $E$ is treated as a constant
  and with the assumption that all one-dimensional marginals of the non-Gaussian distribution
  over $E$ have non-Gaussian moments. In this paper, we propose a simple spectral
  algorithm called \textscReweighted PCA, and prove that it possesses the same guarantee.
  The principle that underlies this approach is a new characterization of multivariate
  Gaussian distributions.
