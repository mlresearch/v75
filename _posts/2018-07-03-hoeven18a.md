title: The Many Faces of Exponential Weights in Online Learning
abstract: A standard introduction to online learning might place Online Gradient Descent
  at its center and then proceed to develop generalizations and extensions like Online
  Mirror Descent and second-order methods. Here we explore the alternative approach
  of putting Exponential Weights (EW) first. We show that many standard methods and
  their regret bounds then follow as a special case by plugging in suitable surrogate
  losses and playing the EW posterior mean. For instance, we easily recover Online
  Gradient Descent by using EW with a Gaussian prior on linearized losses, and, more
  generally, all instances of Online Mirror Descent based on regular Bregman divergences
  also correspond to EW with a prior that depends on the mirror map. Furthermore,
  appropriate quadratic surrogate losses naturally give rise to Online Gradient Descent
  for strongly convex losses and to Online Newton Step. We further interpret several
  recent adaptive methods (iProd, Squint, and a variation of Coin Betting for experts)
  as a series of closely related reductions to exp-concave surrogate losses that are
  then handled by Exponential Weights. Finally, a benefit of our EW interpretation
  is that it opens up the possibility of sampling from the EW posterior distribution
  instead of playing the mean. As already observed by Bubeck and Eldan, this recovers
  the best-known rate in Online Bandit Linear Optimization.
