title: Efficient active learning of sparse halfspaces
abstract: We study the problem of efficient PAC active learning of homogeneous linear
  classifiers (halfspaces) in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the goal is to learn a halfspace
  with low error using as few label queries as possible. Under the extra assumption
  that there is a $t$-sparse halfspace that performs well on the data ($t ≪d$), we
  would like our active learning algorithm to be {\em attribute efficient}, i.e. to
  have label requirements sublinear in $d$. In this paper, we provide a computationally
  efficient algorithm that achieves this goal. Under certain distributional assumptions
  on the data, our algorithm achieves a label complexity of $O(t ⋅\mathrm{polylog}(d,
  \frac 1 ε))$. In contrast, existing algorithms in this setting are either computationally
  inefficient, or subject to label requirements polynomial in $d$ or $\frac 1 ε$.
