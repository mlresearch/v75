title: 'Learning Without Mixing: Towards A Sharp Analysis of Linear System Identification'
abstract: 'We prove that the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator attains nearly
  minimax optimal performance for the identification of linear dynamical systems from
  a single observed trajectory. Our upper bound relies on a generalization of Mendelsonâ€™s
  small-ball method to dependent data, eschewing the use of standard mixing-time arguments.
  Our lower bounds reveal that these upper bounds match up to logarithmic factors.
  In particular, we capture the correct signal-to-noise behavior of the problem, showing
  that \emph{more unstable} linear systems are \emph{easier} to estimate. This behavior
  is qualitatively different from arguments which rely on mixing-time calculations
  that suggest that unstable systems are more difficult to estimate. We generalize
  our technique to provide bounds for a more general class of linear response time-series. '
